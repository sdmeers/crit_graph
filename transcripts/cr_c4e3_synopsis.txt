Synopsis
Cold open
Teor Pridesire has been directed to talk to the head of security of House Halovar about becoming a bodyguard of Wicander Halovar. She tells him that the Mercanaund Couturier will help him outfit himself appropriately, giving him money to do so. When Sir Filoneus Halovar arrives along with his two war dogs, he welcomes Teor to the team, claps him on the back, and sends him off to see the couturier, but Teor wonders what awaits him there. Nearby at the Palazzo Davinos, Julien Davinos is leaving to search for Occtis Tachonis, remembering that someone resembling the family was in company with Thaisha Lloy at the funeral of Thjazi Fang at Halandil Fang's home. He goes through the marketplace, seeing the notices forbidding the use of arcane magic there, and encounters Teor, recognizing him as a former companion of Thjazi Fang. Teor tells Julian he has recently allied with the Candescent Creed. While Julian realizes the Halovars have likely sent Teor to be killed at the Couturier, he says nothing about it and continues on his way.

Part I
In the cellar of the Villa Aurora of House Halovar, Wicander Halovar confronts for the first time a towering, imprisoned, feral celestial which his grandmother the Photarch introduces as his grandfather. Wicander's elder sister Lady Zebani Halovar enters along with Tyranny's sister Cruelty, and no one seems surprised by the captive angel. Wicander learns the Filament is the bodily fluid of the celestial, which has been drunk and used to tattoo on many people's bodies including his own. It was also used as a material component in a Wish spell that resulted in the birth of his father, Godard Halovar. His grandmother tells him his proposed marriage to Ebecca D'Antonio for family business purposes must move forward, although he does not know her well. Wick, stunned, agrees to everything his grandmother says, and Tyranny eventually suggests a warm bath to relax. Before they leave, Wick asks what his grandmother meant when she told him to get rid of Teor Pridesire, and she responds that it's already done.

Once in Wicander's private chambers, he confronts Tyranny, shocked that she apparently already knew all this. She explains she was "given a body six months ago" and was told to make him look good. While at first she thought it was funny that he was the only one who didn't know the truth behind the Candescent Creed, she now thinks his family is afraid of him because he actually cares. She stresses that her contract is with him, not his family, and they both think they should go see what has happened to Teor. Before he leaves his room, unsure of when he'll return, Wick packs a few items including the portrait of a woman he once loved.

Meanwhile, Lord Primus Tachonis confronts Dean Ellipides Tallbarrel and Murray Mag'Nesson in the Dean's office in the Penteveral, demanding to know where his son Occtis, a student there, is. Murray is flippantly rude to him, and he promises to have the new dean discipline her, but she admits that Occtis has indeed managed to work out a way to manipulate the "gifts of shadow" despite his total lack of his family's sorcerous talents. She then tells him she hasn't seen Occtis in some time, and Lord Primus responds by trying to cast a curse upon her, which she resists. She notices, however, that he does not seem to be the one actually casting the spell, and attempts to surreptitiously cast Detect Magic by picking at the jewels inset into her teeth. The Dean notices and quietly Counterspells her before Messaging her to get out. Murray complies, angrily going in search of Occtis.

Elsewhere, Thimble, Kattigan, and Occtis are in the headquarters of the Crow Keepers, confronting guildmaster Solomon while in search of the missing Casimir Gavendale. When Casimir's name is mentioned, tension immediately escalates despite Thimble's failed effort to get the Guild to stand down. She hides in the pants of one of the thieves and threatens to chop his balls off. Occtis fails to cast Cause Fear on Solomon while Kattigan tries to grab him. The rogue reaches into his pants, pulls out Thimble, and shoves her in a drawstring bag, while two others bind Wulfric's paws and another hits Kattigan. Just then, Vaelus crashes through a window and attacks with her censer-whip, killing the thief holding Thimble with a critical blow. Thimble casts Faerie Fire before hiding in the rafters, and Occtis hits him with Fire Bolt. Kattigan clubs another thief before Vaelus kills Solomon with Guiding Bolt. She then whispers, "Run," and the remaining criminals flee except for one who seemed to recognize Occtis was in disguise, and whom they keep in order to interrogate.

The thoroughly intimidated thief tells them that the Guild had discovered that Casimir was embezzling from them, and owed them a huge debt. However, he paid that debt in full the preceding morning, the same morning that Thimble had been attacked. She now realizes one of the masked attackers was probably Casimir. Casimir and his gang had new gear and a deed of title to a stronghouse in Gormalay in the north in addition to a massive amount of gold. While Casimir had been in the guildhall, Cyd rushed in, shouting about the missing wagon to have been used to rescue Thjazi Fang. When he saw the gold and the deed, Cyd grabbed the deed of title and ran out, pursued by Casimir and his gang.

The group suspects that Casimir had acquired the money through selling Thjazi and Thimble's possessions, including the Stone of Nightsong that Vaelus seeks. They decide they need to find Teor and tell him what they've learned about his brother Cyd, and realize he would probably return to Halandil Fang's home.

Part II
The Hallowed Round by @zhellers

Halandil Fang is showing off the progress on renovating The Hallowed Round theater to Thaisha and Shadia. Mother and daughter have a brief conversation moving toward reconnection before Bolaire arrives in a carriage, bringing the crates filled with paints that arrived at his museum. He has checked them and found them oddly magical, as if either a lot of magic has happened near them, or they use a kind of magic Bolaire has never seen before. Hal is perplexed by the posthumous gift from his brother, mentioned with his last words before his hanging and accompanied with a note reading, "With love." As Hal inspects it, Bolaire senses magic rising under the city, and nearby something unseen turns and slithers away.

In Caravan Hill, Murray runs into her friend Azune patrolling with some other Arcane Marshals. They duck into an alley to converse privately, and Azune tells her that the Sundered Houses are closing in on both the Revolutionary Guard and on the Penteveral. They compare notes, learning that Lord Knight Einfasen is threatening the Guard, and Lord Primus Tachonis the Penteveral. Azune believes the Arcane Marshals are safe for now since they do things the lords cannot. Murray hasn't slept and is exhausted, but tells Azune that Primus is looking for Occtis, and Azune says he knows where he is, excusing himself with the other guards and heading off with Murray.

Meanwhile, Teor has arrived at the Mercanaud Couturier and greeted by the twin proprietors. When he says he was sent by the Candescent Creed, he is led into a back fitting room filled with the scent of a strange incense. Teor's Divine Sense registers nothing strange, but he feels woozy and suddenly is hit by two Hold Person spells, and then a strong sense of fiendish magic. As the paralysis takes hold, one of the fiends says, "My shears, brother."

Some hours later, after dark, Wicander and Tyranny arrive. She is recognized by the proprietor and tells him that Scion Wicander has come to talk to their "guest" before he gets "outfitted". Wick tells him they're there to retrieve him in order to deal with him themselves, and Tyranny supports his lie convincingly. The twin returns the money and items taken from Teor before leading them to him, arms shackled above his head inside a pentagram as the other twin is in the process of cutting his shadow into pieces. As the process is halted, the shadow reconstitutes and Teor is freed, but poisoned and feeble. As they leave, Wick casts Lesser Restoration on him.

In the late afternoon, Julien arrives at Hal's home just as Thimble, Kattigan, Vaelus, and Occtis arrive as well. Thimble is scathing toward Julien and he grabs her by the wings to warn her to be more respectful toward him. When Occtis protests, Julien recognizes his voice even though his appearance is still altered. Saying that Occtis may be in immediate danger, Julien starts off, but stops when he's out of sight and listens to their conversation. Occtis is concerned his family might have figured out he's been working against them. His Disguise Self fades and he says farewell to Thimble and Kattigan who are going in Hal's home search of Teor. Vaelus asks him about Pincushion, the undead fox he has created that now acts as his familiar. She finds this fascinating, asking if he could reanimate a whole body. Just then, Julien accosts the two and pulls them into an alley for a private word. He tells them that Houses Davinos and Royce were aware of a plot to rescue Thjazi. Occtis denies knowing about it, and Julien tells him his family is searching for him. He invites Occtis to come speak with Lady Aranessa.

At sunset, Hal and Thaisha return home to find Kattigan and Thimble waiting for Teor. Thaisha is frantic when she hears that Occtis has gone off with Sir Julien and wild shapes into a wolf to go search for him. Azune and Murray arrive, having discovered the carnage at the thieves' guild has been reported to the Revolutionary Guard with a warning about a dangerous elven murderer on the loose. Vaelus is now being searched for by them. Thimble reports that Casimir was the traitor in their ranks, and that she wants to find Teor quickly so they can go in pursuit of him. Just then, a stumbling Teor arrives, flanked by Halovar and Tyranny, and they assure Thimble they rescued him. Teor warns everyone that the Candescent Creed is secretly evil. Tyranny points out that Wicander risked his life to save Teor, and is therefore now in danger from his and her own families. As the group discusses, Hal goes upstairs and looks closely at his brother's sword, seeing a maker's mark on the blade resembling half a mask with a smirking tongue. As he takes several practice swings, he realizes that from this angle the mark is of a smiling face in profile, the mark of the Lloy family. This is the Liar's Blade, forged for a long-ago war by the Lloy family. Thoughtfully, Hal scabbards it on his back.

Downstairs, the group realizes that five of their number are in serious danger and need to get out of town. Wicander is hesitant about the prospect of sleeping outside but is urged by Tyranny to ask for the group's help, and does so. Teor tells them he owes them his life and is in their service. When Thimble mentions their destination is Gormalay, Wick realizes his family ships Filament and has property there. Azune is torn, wanting to go with his friends, but realizes he can do more good in the city. Hal, still wearing the sword of Thjazi Fang, provides costume cloaks and disguises, while Azune provides horses. The five-- Thimble, Teor, Kattigan, Wicander, and Tyranny, now designated as the Soldiers-- set off northward together in search of justice for Thjazi by confronting Casimir.

Meanwhile, Julien, Occtis, and Vaelus arrive at the beautiful Palazzo Davinos, where they are greeted by Julien's father General Raimond Davinos and Lady Aranessa. Lady Aranessa tells Occtis that his father was at the Penteveral (where Occtis studies) earlier that day, and Occtis agrees to stay at the Palazzo for the time being. As Aranessa leads him upstairs to his room, Vaelus senses something wild and magical moving, and almost can hear the call of a nightingale. From the garden, she sees the wolf wild shape of Thaisha approaching the Palazzo from far off, and has the strong sense that the way must be opened for her. Vaelus uses Command on a guard and stands at the now-opened Palazzo gate, waiting.

Inside, Lady Aranessa asks Occtis if he was involved in the attempt to rescue her husband Thjazi. He prevaricates and she reminds him that the doors to Faerie closed because the overflow of souls that cannot move on due to the death of the gods threatened its heart. Aranessa knows or suspects that Thjazi was collecting items somehow related to this. There is a knock on the door, and Lady Aranessa goes to open it, saying it must be the servants with the fresh bedding.

Raimond's death - ChaChaRae
Fan art of Raimond's death, by Cha Cha Rae.[art 5]

Downstairs, Raimond tells Julien that the Royce caravan has been stopped from entering the city by being halted at the Dvalmer Pass by the Tachonis, whose forces in the city are now tripled. Julien then goes into the garden in search of Vaelus, sharing with her that he has a bad feeling about this night, and Vaelus senses something thicker and more obscure about his shadow, realizing that he has been cursed. When she uses her Divine Sense, she can feel the presence of hundreds of the specters of the dead. As General Raimond walks into the garden addressing his son, a black-clad member of House Tachonis becomes visible and ethereally pulls his skull out of his head, killing him instantly. Upstairs, when Aranessa opens the door, a Silence spell fills the room, and six more black-clad ghouls bearing the Tachonis symbol stand there-- along with Occtis's brother Ethrand holding a perfectly spherical black stone in his hands. Ethrand silently commands the ghouls, "Put him on the table, open him up and we'll put the stone where it belongs."

Quotations
Halandil: (about the new purpose of the dithyramb of Azgra) Well, once we came here to celebrate a god, now we come to celebrate each other.
Tyranny: (asking Halandil about theater) Why do people pretend to be other people? It's so crazy to me.
Halandil: To find the truth.
Tyranny: (to Wicander) You need to figure out really fucking fast who you can trust and who you can't. I'm going to say now that you have directly gone against your family twice, you're not going to be able to trust them very much. So that includes everyone who your family knows.
Brennan: (summing up the members of the Soldiers party) There's Kattigan Vale, who has an open shiner on his face from a bar fight where two people were murdered. There's Thimble, who is a wanted criminal accomplice who was left for dead in Thjazi's hideout. Teor, whose mentor just headed west this morning and who himself was marked for death by the Halovar family who are here in the city knowing that they did that. Then there is Wick, someone that you knew had a reputation for straight-dealing in a family that had a reputation for love of power. Now you're hearing that there's a malevolent magical dimension to the Halovars' previously corrupt noble evil malevolence and you also know that according to Tyranny, it was already bad before he moved against his family and they went and lied or did whatever they did to free Teor in contradiction to the family's wishes.
