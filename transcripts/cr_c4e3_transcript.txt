Cold open
BRENNAN: At a broad table, here in the banquet hall of the Villa Aurora, the Halovar estate. Teor, you are seated on a exquisite, velvet-lined and cushioned seat as a small, white velvet sack of coins lands with a thunk in front of you. The woman speaking to you says, "And of course, for any accoutrement needed for your service as a guardian errant of the Lord Wicander Halovar. The Mercanaud Couturier will be happy to fit you and your gear to our station. We attempt to make clear that violence is always a regrettable, tragic, and final resort; that the weaponry, armor, and tabardry of our various vassals and men-at-arms bear the symbol of the Candescent Creed, but we would shudder to think of you going out of your own pocket for that."

TRAVIS: Oh, that is most understood. I think, if I might suggest an alternative, perhaps for an extra level of security, perhaps I could stay as I am, plainclothes, not draw attention to anything that needs to be done on behalf of the Candescent Creed. A more covert security force.

BRENNAN: Give me a persuasion check.

TRAVIS: Five.

MATT: (laughs)

TRAVIS: Beach (bitch). (laughter)

TRAVIS: Intimidation.

BRENNAN: She goes, "A splendid suggestion. It is such an exciting proposition to imagine, that by wearing the symbol of the Candescent Creed, you may attempt to be covert in proudly wearing the symbol of the order."

TRAVIS: Ah, I see.

BRENNAN: Close behind you, you hear (dog growling, barking) as the door flies open and on these sets of silvery white chains, this massive knight walks in, heavily-armored, gray-bearded, human knight. He's got gleaming luminous tattoos all around his neck that curl up around over his eyes. He walks in and goes, "Ah, you're the (sniffs) former Bannersman, yes?"

TRAVIS: That would be me, Teor.

BRENNAN: "Very well. Well, Teor, it's a pleasure to meet you."

TRAVIS: Your name?

BRENNAN: "My name?" I am Sir Filoneus Halovar. These are my dogs, Wrath and Judgment. I can't tell which one is which, but then again, when it comes to wrath and judgment, (thump), who can?!"

TRAVIS: Indeed. Both beautiful companions.

BRENNAN: One of them snarls and it has a dull glow from the back of the dog's throat. You hear a faint humming from its vocal cords, almost like it can't stop whining. This whining is beautiful, ethereal, almost angelic.

TRAVIS: Such a beautiful noise they make. I've never heard the like.

BRENNAN: "Oh yes, they can't stop singing, these dogs."

TRAVIS: Singing?

BRENNAN: "The song confuses spellcasters. They're good dogs. Glad to have you aboard!" Claps you on the shoulder and says, "Well, you're best on your way to the couturier. We expect you back first thing tomorrow."

TRAVIS: It will be done.

BRENNAN: The handmaiden smiles. Sir Filoneus walks off with the dogs looking over. Give me an insight check.

TRAVIS: Wow. That's good. Natural 19 for a 23.

BRENNAN: There's gold in a pouch in front of you. This has all happened so quickly. You wonder, on that high insight roll, I think you just wonder what's waiting at that couturier. But you see a servant opens the door leading to exit the estate. "We shall be in touch when the Lord Wicander calls for you."

TRAVIS: Most certainly. And I shall, of course, come more appropriately dressed next time.

BRENNAN: "Of course, thank you very much, Master Pridesire, and may the Beam reach you."

TRAVIS: May it reach us all.

BRENNAN: "It always does. Goodbye." You see that as you exit to the street, move over, nearby, not far away from the Villa Aurora at the Palazzo Davinos, we see walking out, under the early afternoon sun, Julien Davinos. Where are you headed to on this morning?

MATT: I'm looking for this Occtis figure. I recall we had an encounter when he was very young many years ago and I thought I caught a keen-- There's a look about the family that's very specific, but was in the company of Thaisha, last I saw.

BRENNAN: Yeah.

MATT: So I would likely be heading towards, probably to house domain to see if I can find where she might be, and then through her, find out where this boy might be.

BRENNAN: Teor, you remember the events of the previous day, but you've had business to attend to with Loza's departure and everything else that's been occurring. Where do you think you would head in this moment?

TRAVIS: I actually think I would head to this place they've sent me to, at least to know what the next step would be, but I would also be trying to keep an eye out for anyone from the funeral that we've seen just in case our paths might cross.

BRENNAN: Give me a perception check with advantage, and Matt, I'd like you to do the same.

TRAVIS: Yeah. That's a 17, 19.

MATT: That was two natural 19s in a row.

BRENNAN: Wow.

MATT: For a 20.

TRAVIS: Not a competition.

BRENNAN: (laughs) Walking through--

MATT: This is always a competition.

BRENNAN: -- the Ogrimock Marketplace, towering shelves of ripe fruit, towering shelves of ripe fruit, spices, produce. You see there's a hanging fish market with fish, blocks of ice that they've been delivered on, raw foodstuffs, and you see fine tapestry, silk, and armories like you wouldn't believe. The Ogrimok Marketplace has some of the finest weapons dealers and armorers in all the world. This is the home of the Lloy family where they built, they smithed the blades made to kill a god, and so you smell steel and forgecraft all around you. You also see parchment nailed with daggers to posts all throughout. By order of the Chamber of the Lords-Advisory, all arcane magic is forbidden by law within the confines of the marketplace. On that high perception, as you keep your head on a swivel, the strange, in a lively market that's still muted-feeling, Julien and Teor catch each other's eye as you move to go to the couturier and you move to the bridge across the River Vrosh to The Rookery.

TRAVIS: Can I help you, stranger?

MATT: Hmm, not at particularly at this moment.

BRENNAN: Teor, you look down and see the symbol, subtle, but on the belt of House Davinos, you briefly saw this guy at the funeral last night. You didn't speak to him, but you saw him in the room.

TRAVIS: That's right. I--

BRENNAN: Or sorry. Red line that. You left before he got there.

TRAVIS: Thought that, yeah.

BRENNAN: You look and see the symbol of House Davinos there in that moment, and I think, Julien, you recognize him as a former companion of Thjazi's.

MATT: No issue at all. You reminded me of someone. It's not a concern.

TRAVIS: Well, that seems like an unlikely possibility. I see you are from House Davinos.

MATT: I am.

TRAVIS: How fares your family?

MATT: Well, our family is in the throes of mourning, as are all at recent events.

TRAVIS: Yes, upset by yesterday's events, are they?

MATT: As tense as our history might've been, Thjazi is a fixed point in our history.

TRAVIS: Yes, a good man, and history, it should stay. I say let bygones be bygones. I am Teor Pridesire. Your name?

MATT: Hmm. This gentleman is in the middle of a marketplace, unnaturally friendly and stepping forward. Can I glean his intent or try and see if I should just brush past?

BRENNAN: Give me an insight check.

MATT: Nine.

TRAVIS: (laughs)

BRENNAN: You cannot read the intent of this commoner here in this place.

MATT: Sir Julien Davinos, Knight of the Vassal House Davinos.

TRAVIS: Sir Julien. Yes, your name carries as much weight as your family's. I have heard much about you and your great deeds.

MATT: Not all of us can have the reverberations through history as souls of such lineage, but it is nice to meet you. I have business elsewhere. He begins to step away.

TRAVIS: If you find yourself in need of business with the Candescent Creed, I have recently allied myself with them. You will find an ally, if you should need one, but I will take my leave, Sir Julien Davinos.

BRENNAN: Give me one more perception with advantage, Julien.

MATT: 19.

BRENNAN: You look and see Teor traveling with a small satchel of coin with the Candescent Creed's symbol on it, and you know that you're nearby this place, the Mercanaud Couturier. In the Sundered Houses, you've heard some rumors, here in Dol-Makjar, or other people that you've consorted with that the Mercanaud are a family that have worked for the Halovars for a long time, that have a lot of fronts, but their main purpose for the Halovars is making problems go away. I think you look over Teor's shoulder and see the direction he was headed in is towards the Mercanaud Couturier.

MATT: I make distinct note of that and then briskly head towards Hal's home.

BRENNAN: (laughs)

TRAVIS: May the Light find you.

MATT: I do not respond.

TRAVIS: (laughs)

BRENNAN: And we'll find out--

TRAVIS: May the Light find you. May the Light find you? Fuck! (laughter)

BRENNAN: And we will discover what happens in that couturier on this episode of Critical Role. (laughter)

Announcements
MATT: And welcome back to the Critical Role Announcement Playhouse!

MARISHA and LAURA: Woo!

MATT: For tonight, our sponsor is Czepeku. Sam?

LIAM: He's never here.

SAM: (exhausted panting)

LAURA: Oh god.

MATT: Oh no. (groaning)

SAM: Are you guys ready to map in shape?

LIAM: I take it back.

MATT: What are we--

LAURA: Why are you so sweaty?

SAM: I can't hear you. Are you ready to map in shape? Because Czepeku is the leading maker of RPG fantasy maps, whether you play at home or on a VTT. When I hear battle maps, I think of one thing: fitness!

LIAM: Why is his junk so prominent?

MARISHA: I can't stop looking at it.

SAM: I'm going to teach you guys three easy exercises you can do with your Czepeku maps to tone up and yoke out. Hit that music! It'll play.

LAURA: I don't believe you. ♪ (upbeat aerobics music) ♪ (laughter)

ASHLEY: Oh wow, that sounds great.

SAM: Oh yeah, here we go. Let's start with--

SAM: Why do you look like this?

TALIESIN: There's a stain just for us. No one else can see. Oh god!

SAM: We'll start with a Cze' pec press. Really isolates your chest abductors. And with over high-res battle maps, you'll always have a new map to pump to.

TRAVIS: It's very David Bowie.

SAM: Okay, let's do another one.

TALIESIN: There might be a rash under there.

LAURA: I love this.

TRAVIS: Oh.

LIAM: Oh, for me?

SAM: I'm going to use this map as a yoga map. (chuckling)

SAM: Here, this one, if you just scroll down-- Next, use your map as a yoga map and fire those glutoro maximos with scene dips. We're going to do because Czepeku offers more than 2,000 fantasy scenes with 200 animated versions.

MATT: You probably shouldn't do 2,000.

SAM: Okay.

TALIESIN: Please don't.

SAM: Lastly, ladies, this is the token builder.

TALIESIN: Oh! Oh god!

MARISHA: What? (laughter)

ASHLEY: Wow.

TALIESIN: Oh wow.

SAM: With more than 300 hand-drawn tokens, you'll want to thrust these into your home game over and over. Woo! My anterior medial plexus is on fire.

TRAVIS: That's not a real muscle.

MARISHA: I can't even see the map.

SAM: Woo! Oh!

LAURA: Show us a map!

SAM: So are you guys ready to get sweaty? (laughter)

LIAM: Yeah!

TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Yeah!

SAM: I can't hear you.

MATT: No.

TALIESIN: No.

SAM: Okay, great. Then feel the burn and subscribe to the complete fantasy bundle. I'm exhausted. (laughter)

SAM: Get the map scenes and token subscriptions for just the price of two. Critters can stretch their wallets--

TRAVIS: Wow.

SAM: -- with 50% off for the first three months. Jog down to go.czepeku.com/critical-role and grab the complete fantasy-- Oh no, my stuffing is moving.

LIAM: Stuffing? Stuffing?! (laughter)

SAM: Yeah, it's a--

TALIESIN: That's a weird name for it.

MATT: Just keep going. Just keep going.

SAM: For just $25-- See, it's a pear.

ASHLEY: Oh it's a pear! (laughter)

SAM: And not just thousands of beautiful maps--

MATT: Comparison is the thief of joy.

SAM: -- map scenes and tokens designed to flex your tabletop adventures and new content added weekly. Oh god, there's more. Each map comes--

MATT: Why is it so baggy now?

SAM: -- pre-made with my--

ASHLEY: It got so loose so fast.

SAM: -- sweat already on it. Matt, clean and jerk to you. (groaning)

TRAVIS: Oh, nice.

MATT: Oh boy. What have we done?

MARISHA: Okay.

LIAM: Technically--

TRAVIS: Thank you, Sam.

LIAM: Technically, I subscribed to that bundle decades ago.

TRAVIS: Thank you.

MARISHA: Wow.

LAURA: Wow.

TRAVIS: I feel healthier just from watching that.

TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

LAURA: Wow.

MATT: Our next sponsor is PlayStation and their brand new game, "Ghost of Yotei." Love, grief, and revenge collide in "Ghost of Yotei," a new PlayStation 5 experience set in 1600's Japan. You'll play as Atsu, a mercenary on a quest to avenge her family, traveling across snow-capped ridges and forgotten shrines to confront those who wronged her. Along the way, you'll strike with brutal precision using weapons like the odachi and the kusarigama, while forging bonds that endure far beyond battle. We're especially excited because a friend of the show, Erika Ishii, voices Atsu, joining Critical Role's castmates Ashley Johnson and Laura Bailey as unforgettable PlayStation characters. Atsu's journey across Ezo is a breathtaking and emotional story of vengeance, healing, and redemption. Then stick around if you want to see how beautiful and brutal this game is as the trailer is coming up later during the break. Now "Ghost of Yotei" is available now on PlayStation 5. Thank you, PlayStation, for sponsoring this episode, Rated M for Mature. Hmm. Laura, you're up.

LAURA: Now you can collect the first ever Critical Role trading cards from Rittenhouse Archives.

TRAVIS: What? First ever?

LIAM: Oh!

LAURA: These cards feature heroes, villains, deities-- Is it deities? And gods from across Exandria. (laughter)

LIAM: We've been working on these forever. Our authentic autograph cards are signed by the cast, that's you guys and me, as well as one of a kind relic cards like Matt's hand-drawn maps, or Laura's Imogen notebook. They're on the damn cards!

ASHLEY: These are so cool!

LAURA: Yeah, these are so beautiful.

MATT: Oh yeah.

MARISHA: They're so pretty.

LIAM: I'm buying a binder with card sleeves.

TALIESIN: We need to do a card party again.

MARISHA: I love the foil that's on them, too.

LAURA: I know, it's so fancy!

LIAM: These are quality, bruv. They're quality.

MATT: All right. And some amazing Daggerheart actual players are kicking off. Right now, you can watch the long-form campaign of Bonus Action, a YouTube actual play that just converted its campaign to Daggerheart. Go back and see where it all began, or jump right into the Daggerheart part of their tale and join their Fantastic Peaches community in watching.

Part I
BRENNAN: We return, deep underground in front of the opening of the Prismatic Retort, whereupon a towering celestial with gnashing teeth strains and fights against massive chains, each link more than an arm's width around. Enormous muscles ripple across this monstrous body. Multiple skeletal fingers, more like a bat's wings than a bird's, stretch out and grind and crack against more chains, enclosures. You see, "(shrieks)" the face ravaged by pain and misery "(snarls)" as gleaming saliva or perhaps blood, spills down from his mouth. Your grandmother, Yanessa, turns and says, "It's something that's almost too hard to be believed. Wicky, my little ducky, I love you and I understand that this is unusual."

SAM: I take a step back, gripping my cane, and I think just looking around at the craziness of this image, of this gigantic monster thrashing about, and then also juxtaposed with everybody feeling like it's commonplace or looking like they've seen this a hundred times before, and I guess I'm staring at different faces to try to register who is surprised by this, if anyone.

BRENNAN: She says, "Ah-- I.' Your father does not look surprised at all. Nearby, you see your elder sister emerges. This is the Lady Zebani Halovar, and trailing behind her is your sister, Tyranny; Cruelty. Zebani steps forward, your older sister. "Glad you're finally in the fold, Wick."

SAM: I look to Tyranny to find any sort of support in anyone's glance, and I'll nod to my sister and say: Oh, yes, I've been, I suppose, educated as to-- I'm sorry, the Filament is-- is that creature's blood?

BRENNAN: (Yanessa) "No, no, no, Wicky."

SAM: Oh.

BRENNAN: "It ain't got blood. It is Light, you know, but it's in his body, yeah, but it's also his spit. You know, it's hard to say. It is Light. It's just, it's just what he's made of, innit?"

SAM: It's not the distilled liquid of the universe?

BRENNAN: "(sighs)"

SAM: We've been drinking this from the Radiant Chalice. We've been tattooing it on my body.

BRENNAN: "Many people's bodies, yeah. A lot of bodies. Wick, 70 years ago, a bunch of lunatics and idiots stood up to kill the gods. Now, the gods died, so maybe they weren't gods. If you can kill them, are they gods? Seems unreasonable, but that doesn't mean that the world was ready to stop believing in something. What's more beautiful than believing in something?"

SAM: Nothing.

BRENNAN: "Nothing."

SAM: Faith fuels us, yes.

BRENNAN: "Of course! So you've got to give people something to believe in."

SAM: And we gave them this.

BRENNAN: "Yes. The Filament, we don't know that it's not condensed Light from the cosmos. We just have a place that we get it from. When I was a young girl, they came for us. They wanted to destroy our family, the Halovars. We were the family of flames. We were the right hand of the Obridimian royal house. We served what we believed to be a god true, and they cast us down, slaughtered us. They would've preferred that we all be destroyed. Your grandfather, Aetheon."

SAM: Aetheon?

BRENNAN: "Aetheon."

SAM: The way that you cocked your head made me think that maybe that's not his name, or--?

BRENNAN: "No, it is."

SAM: Okay, okay.

BRENNAN: "Well, it was. It still is, but he was the servant of the sun."

SAM: And you married him?

BRENNAN: "No, no, no, no. That'd be disgusting."

SAM: Oh.

BRENNAN: "I didn't. He's your grandfather because I took some of his blood and I used it for a spell, and I made a wish, and my wish was to have a child."

SAM: Oh.

BRENNAN: "And that was your father, Godard, and Godard has always had a gift." You see your father has this blindfold on again and you look at that enormous, top-heavy protrusion in his back, and he turns and goes, "Mother, might I?" She says, "Yes, darling." He removes his coat, undoes his shirt, and you see tight wrapped bandages. There's no red, but you realize that some kind of bright light fluid is coming through on his back, and as he releases it, you see these two stunted naked wings extend from his back "(grunts)" and immediately grow luminous, beautiful feathers. White eagle's wings. "(inhales, exhales) Thank you, Mother." "I had a baby boy."

SAM: Yes, you did. Well--

BRENNAN: "It was all taken from us, you understand? The Halovars were-- All we ever did was serve the Light. We served the Light when we thought that the Light was from Tansul, and then Tansul died, and when Tansul died, the heart of the Obridimian Empire erupted into eternal darkness. Lands shriveled, crops failed, an entire people dispossessed. Tell me, what is the justice of that revolution?"

SAM: There's none. No, something needed to be done, something that people needed to be shown goodness again.

BRENNAN: "When the houses were sundered, as we were, our lands destroyed, we had to act. The Royce had their Golden Orchard halfway between here and the fairies, and the Tachonis, whatever they did. We used our wealth. We started trading. We had some holdings in other lands. We got back on our feet. We helped after the Shapers' War, didn't we?"

SAM: Of course.

BRENNAN: "We accepted what had been, but we didn't forget, did we? When I was a young girl, Aetheon, without the god of the sun, he went feral. He'd lost his connection to his maker. You understand why that would be frightening, right, Tyranny?"

WHITNEY: Of course, Photarch.

BRENNAN: "See? And yeah, the demons, you know, people need a good story to believe in. When I found Aetheon, I knew that he shouldn't fall into the wrong hands and I knew that he would still want for the Light to shine. Now, we couldn't call it Tansul, because of everything that happened, but the Light could come back. They can have their revolution, they can say that mortals will stand where the gods once did, but nobody really fucking believes that. People need the lie."

SAM: They do. I'm sorry, I'm just taking this all in and-- No, no, what you're saying, it rings true. We were doing this for the right reasons.

BRENNAN: "Of course we were."

SAM: To give the people hope and faith in something. To maintain the good trust of the Halovars. To spread joy amidst chaos.

BRENNAN: "If you can't be an empire, you take your licks, you pick yourself up, you dust yourself off, and you start a church or a merchant company, something."

SAM: Sure.

BRENNAN: "You understand, don't you?"

SAM: I do.

BRENNAN: "I know it's an enormous secret and I do feel bad."

SAM: No, no, I've just a bit shocked that everyone--

BRENNAN: "Well, that was your mother."

SAM: Everyone knew.

BRENNAN: "That was your mother. Iris--" Iris loves the whole Creed. I mean, she just, it's like, she keeps reciting it. She'll recite it to me interpersonally, and I'll be like: 'I wrote that. 'Why are you talking to me about that?'"

SAM: She does. She did read it to me as a bedtime every night for my whole life.

BRENNAN: "Right, and I let her-- Your elder sister had to be brought--" You see Zebani is just staring straight ahead. "We needed someone that could run the basement, and your mother had a very convincing argument that we needed you to marry Ebecca, young Ebecca. We needed you and we didn't want the secret to spread out to them and keeping a secret from your spouse, so we said, 'What if he's a true believer?' and there was some part of me that said, Well, if I've done my job and the Creed is that believable that even my grandson believes it, then there's a poetry to that, innit?"

SAM: Yes. Yes, Grandmother. It is poetic. I shrink back at the sight of the thrashing monster. Yes, I suppose it is beautiful in its way, and forgive me for just taking a moment to take it all in, but of course you had your reasons, and of course, they were right. I suppose I'll just need a moment to process it all, that's all--

BRENNAN: "Of course."

SAM: -- and to find out what I'm meant to do. What am I meant to do?

BRENNAN: "Everything!"

SAM: Am I still the Scion of the family? Am I still--

BRENNAN: Zebani says "It's a great question." You see that Yanessa turns to her and says, "Zebani! That's enough out of you. Your sister, everyone has their gifts. Your sister's very skilled. She's not set up to be the face of much of anything, is she?"

SAM: She's lovely!

WHITNEY: (scoffs)

SAM: She's lovely.

BRENNAN: "We need a little more honesty around here."

SAM: I think I could carry the family's name very well.

BRENNAN: "I think you can, too, but the reason I had to tell you is this whole thing with Thjazi Fang and you pushing this thing with Hal, it was just-- The things that we say in the Creed, it's good rules. You write down these rules because you know that people you don't know are going to read them, and you want there to be something that makes the ground under your feet steady. You need some reliability, right? It's sort of like-- think about this, right? There's a lake with fish in it, and it's good fish, but it's not yours, it's the king's, and you want to poach those fish, yeah? But if everybody does it, it'd be all out of fish because that's why the rule's there, so the ideal situation is only you poach the fish so you get your fish, but nobody else does because they believe in the rule that you shouldn't do that. Does that make sense?"

SAM: I mean, couldn't you just share enough fish with everybody?

BRENNAN: "Wick, I need you to listen to me!"

SAM: Yes, it's not about the fish, is it?

BRENNAN: "Thjazi Fang had to die for reasons that were political, for reasons that are setting ourselves up to stay close to people that we don't know what they're doing, so I've got you in my ear like a gnat talking about spreading the faith, and listen, we do need to spread the faith to Dol-Makjar, for sure, but the zeal was coming from something in your heart that you thought we needed to listen to these-- You're quoting the Creed to me all the time, so--

SAM: It's beautiful. I mean, the--

BRENNAN: "Just don't do it anymore. The Creed is--"

SAM: All right.

BRENNAN: "-- exactly what we need it to be."

SAM: It serves a perfect purpose, like a tool.

BRENNAN: "Exactly!"

SAM: Yes.

BRENNAN: "Exactly, and a smith looking at a hammer and saying, 'Well, I'm going to let the hammer boss me around.' That's demented."

SAM: Yes, of course. I've been looking at it the wrong way, I suppose.

BRENNAN: "I know. I hate your mother. She--"

SAM: Oh.

BRENNAN: "I am so sorry. I should never have let this happen and it's gone too long, but we're fixing it now."

SAM: Right. Right. Yes. Yes, we are fixing it now, and I think I understand and I'm up to the task. Yes. Just, sorry. Yes, Grandmother.

BRENNAN: You see she looks at you and says, "I know you had this romance thing with the one who got away, but this marriage to the D'Antonio needs to happen."

SAM: Right, yes. While all cards are on the table, so to speak, why, again, must I marry this woman? I mean, she seems lovely on paper, but I don't know her at all.

BRENNAN: "So her father is very old in age, and I believe their son is younger and is more or less abdicated from his position there. They sit on a plot of land with a series of vineyards that produce a magical, an alchemical element within the fruit of that vineyard that will allow the Filament that we can dilute it pretty considerably."

SAM: All right.

BRENNAN: "It will be, we'll be able to increase the production by an absolutely staggering--"

SAM: Sure, sure. No, that sounds reasonable as well, yes. All right.

WHITNEY: Photarch Yanessa--

SAM: Oh.

WHITNEY: So sorry to speak out of turn. It's been a big day for my scion and I was wondering if I might go draw him a hot bath so he can decompress and think about his next steps.

BRENNAN: You see she smiles and says, "What a thoughtful demon you are. That sounds lovely. Now not as hot as you'd like it, otherwise my little grandson will get burned."

WHITNEY: Don't want to cook him.

BRENNAN: "Don't want to cook him. Ah, a boiled grandson!"

WHITNEY: (laughs)

SAM: Oh, that would not be good.

WHITNEY: Shall we?

SAM: (sighs) Yes.

BRENNAN: Anything--

SAM: One more thing, sorry. Earlier you said to get rid of Teor, Teor the lion fellow. Did you mean for me to get rid of him?

BRENNAN: "My grandson, I would never ask you to do such a thing. It's already done."

SAM: Oh. All right.

BRENNAN: "Your life will be mostly the same going forward. We just needed you to know enough to stop, stop believing."

SAM: Well, thank you for that, that gift. I'll, um-- I'll-- I'll go get in that bath now and wash this day away.

BRENNAN: "That's what I like to hear, Wicky. I'll see you bright and early. The rising of the sun, nice hot bath. There might be a little sweet treat. By the way, now that, you know, you've disabused yourself of some of these extremely oppressive convictions, if there's any treats you have been missing, accommodations can be made when you know the truth."

SAM: Oh. I've been keeping my body pure for all these years.

BRENNAN: "You've actually been-- Is that true?"

WHITNEY: It's true.

BRENNAN: "Woo! Well. What a diligent-- Your willpower will be of great benefit to this family moving forward. I can only imagine what your dedication will manifest for this family now that it might be turned to more fruitful purposes."

SAM: (laughs) Right, yes, I-- Yes, yes. I suppose a new horizon is ahead of me.

BRENNAN: "You are the grandson of a celestial. You do not get your powers from your devotion to poetry. You get them because of the blood that runs in your veins. It's our family first always, Wicander."

SAM: Oh, all is bright, all is right.

BRENNAN: "All is right. I love you. (smooch)"

SAM: I love you, Grandma.

BRENNAN: "Hot bath!" You-- (laughter) (laughter)

WHITNEY: Ah! (laughter)

BRENNAN: Whitney, could you describe the beautiful clawfoot bathtub? (laughs)

WHITNEY: Oh my god, it's like 20 feet.

BRENNAN: (laughs)

WHITNEY: It's so big. It's the size of a pool.

BRENNAN: Gorgeous.

WHITNEY: It is ornate gold and turquoise inlay, claw feet. There's a roiling fire underneath that is enchanted to keep it at just (chef's kiss) the perfect temperature and it is surrounded by shimmering curtains that are, you know, like a mosquito net, but fancy.

BRENNAN: Gorgeous. Scorching hot water, (water hisses) steam and noise, noise of hot running water covering any conversation as the two of you move into Wicander's private chambers.

SAM: You knew? You knew?!

WHITNEY: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah!

SAM: When? How?

WHITNEY: Okay. All right.

SAM: You're supposed to protect, observe, and obey.

WHITNEY: I was supposed to keep you believing. Wick, okay, I'm just going to run this down--

SAM: Protect means telling me things.

WHITNEY: I couldn't tell you. Let me just-- I was given a body six months ago with the explicit purpose to make you look good, okay? I am hired by your family. I am not going to be saved. I'm a demon, man. You can't save a demon. I was hired--

SAM: But you've made a lot of progress.

WHITNEY: Thank you. Your family has been in bed with my family for a very long time, okay? My maker, Ksha'aravi, the High Prince of Demonkind and the Shadow of Suffering--

SAM: Okay.

WHITNEY: -- brought me to you to spread the word of the Candescent Creed. In exchange, he is getting Filament. He is getting souls. This is a harmonious relationship that your family has had with my family since I was just swirling in The Pit.

SAM: Of course, I should know. Of course, I should have expected this. You're a demon. You tantalize humans with your words and you corrupt us with your lies--

WHITNEY: No!

SAM: -- and you're just like them.

WHITNEY: No!

SAM: I understand.

WHITNEY: No. Okay.

SAM: Yes.

WHITNEY: Listen. I'm not like them. I will admit, first month I was here, I thought it was kind of funny that you didn't know. My sisters were very much in on it. But then I saw that you were the only one who actually believed in it and also really believed that you could save me, and you can't. I'm sorry, you can't. But I think your family is afraid of you. You're not--

SAM: Of me?

WHITNEY: You're not a pariah. What you did, you went off book with Thjazi. You have willpower and that's why they brought you in, because they're scared of you. And I just want to say that my contract is with you, it's not with your family, and you can cast me back to The Pit anytime you want, and I will go back, and I really don't want to, and you're going to really have to figure out what your actual beliefs are because all of this is a lie in exchange for power. My sisters are doing insane shit to hypnotize masses, to do crowd control, to spread the power of your family to keep them rich and powerful. They don't care about what happens to people after they die. They don't care. But you do. If you want to just be a noble and be, turn the other way, I don't know, I don't know where your head is actually at.

SAM: What else, what are my choices? My grandmother commanded me to do this and my father, my sister, everyone expects me to toe the family line, so I must do that.

WHITNEY: I think you're going to really need to think about what you believe in, and I'm not going to try to sway you. I will say, that big tall lion man--

SAM: Oh right.

WHITNEY: -- Teor, yeah. I think that we should look into his story.

SAM: Wait, she said they were going to kill--

WHITNEY: I know. I don't know about that.

SAM: No, no, no, we can't let that happen. I-- I don't forgive you for not telling me, but I suppose I understand. If everyone was in on this, then you couldn't just very well expose yourself and go against the family. It seems like they have command over large creatures and small and demonkind as well.

WHITNEY: Wick, they don't have command over demonkind. You're not like your family and I'm not like my family. For a minute, they kept you out because they thought you couldn't handle it because you were the face, and your belief-- Which is still true, by the way. All of the things that you've taught me, I think you really believe.

SAM: I do. Everyone is inherently good and has the Light flowing within them. Listen. I need to think about this, but before I do, I really think we need to go warn that hairy man that he's about to die. Do you know where he might've gone?

WHITNEY: Do I?

BRENNAN: You know exactly where he would get sent. If the grandma already took care of him, there's a tailor shop in the market they would've sent him to and they'd be dealing with him.

WHITNEY: Yeah, there's a tailor shop in the market and he'll be dealt with there. (off-stage chuckling)

SAM: Why a tailor? That seems like a--

WHITNEY: I don't know, I think--

SAM: That's dangerous?

WHITNEY: I'm sure, I mean tailors have needles. I don't know.

SAM: Okay. Well then do you know where this tailor is? Could we go there?

WHITNEY: I know where he is. Can you--

SAM: Can you show me the way, even though I guess I'm a failure and--

WHITNEY: Hey, you're not a, hey--

SAM: No, no. I'm just, I've been, I'm easily bamboozled my entire life and I--

WHITNEY: No, you were taught to believe in something and you do. That actually shows that you have strength of character and believe in something. My sisters are so happy to see all of this puppet mastery and see the crowd getting manipulated and your family be brought into this place of control because they get souls, and I don't want to be a part of that. Please don't send me back.

SAM: Of course I'm not going to send you back. You've been my--

WHITNEY: Here's what I think. Here's what I think.

SAM: -- my only friend.

WHITNEY: Play the part. Go with it. Play the part and we'll talk to Teor and we'll figure out what to do next, but you cannot betray that you feel any different. You did really good in there.

SAM: I think I peed my robes a little bit.

WHITNEY: I know, there was a reason that I wanted to draw you a bath.

SAM: Right. (off-screen laughter)

SAM: All right, to the haberdashery. We must go.

WHITNEY: The tailor, but yeah.

SAM: Yes.

BRENNAN: Tyranny, you rush to get a carriage together, and Wicander, as you prepare to head out and warn this wielder of the Light you saw earlier today, you look and see on your desk a small, silver, filigreed frame turned the other direction amongst your belongings.

SAM: Is it not normally like that?

BRENNAN: It's normally like that. You turned it around a long time ago.

SAM: Oh. May I shift it around?

BRENNAN: It's the face of a commoner who once mattered a great deal to you, but you were told that the Light had not chosen for that love to unfold. It was not destined to be.

SAM: Yes. I pick up her portrait and stare at it a bit as Tyranny's off making preparations to leave and I will take--

WHITNEY: Oh, no, I am watching you watch that picture.

SAM: Oh.

WHITNEY: I am looking.

SAM: I'll take it out of the frame. I'll put it in a small satchel, gather a few items, unclear of when I'll come back, grab my cane, grab a flask of water, and I guess head out.

BRENNAN: You head out. With that, I'll say goodbye to you both. Marisha, you want to jump in?

SAM: Do we stay, we go?

BRENNAN: You go.

SAM: Okay.

WHITNEY: You can party now.

SAM: My tolerance.

WHITNEY: It took me everything in my being to not make a joke about Squirt when you said demon blood is made of a bunch of stuff.

BRENNAN: (laughs)

MARISHA: I wasn't expecting to jump in here now either. Okay, here we go, I'm here, I'm here. Where's my iPad?!

BRENNAN: Go grab your iPad.

OFFSCREEN: Lock in.

MARISHA: We're live at this.

BRENNAN: Hi America, it's Brennan Lee Mulligan here. (laughter) Check in with yourself.

MARISHA: "Check in with yourself."

OFFSCREEN: "Check in with yourself."

MARISHA: No further thought.

BRENNAN: You can't prove there's allegory in this.

MARISHA: (laughs)

MARISHA: Help. Help, it's again.

BRENNAN: Help, help. Murray.

MARISHA: Yes?

BRENNAN: Standing across from you in the doorway is the tall figure of the Lord Primus Tachonis.

MARISHA: Uh-huh.

BRENNAN: Gazing at you and Dean Tallbarrel. His eyes pass over you and you feel the saliva cool in the back of your mouth as you (gulp) almost like you're choking for a moment as his eyes glance across and alight on Dean Tallbarrel. "Ellipides, I am given to understand that until the stroke of six this evening, you are Dean of this institution, are you not?" Dean Tallbarrel goes, "Yes, I am, it's true, it's true." He sneers a little bit and says, "I'm searching for my son, Occtis. He was sent here some years ago to your boarding school. He arrived at the age of maturity and manifested no sorcerous powers whatsoever. Our family," you see he looks over at you and says, "Is something wrong with your eyes?"

MARISHA: Oh, sorry, no, I just, (coughs) (sniffs) I think it's allergies.

BRENNAN: "I wouldn't be surprised. There's something wrong with your teeth, certainly."

MARISHA: Oh yeah, you like 'em?

BRENNAN: "No."

MARISHA: Oh, well, fuck you. (laughs)

BRENNAN: You see Ellipides goes, "(sputters)" and just-- He says, "What she means to say," and you see that Primus turns and says, "Coarse language like that will not be tolerated. I'll speak to Dean Kora about disciplinary measures. I'm looking for my child. I understand that he boards here in your dormitories."

MARISHA: Occtis, right? A little weasel-y fucker, right? A little gangly man, built like a string bean? (laughs)

BRENNAN: "Yes."

MARISHA: I think that's who you're talking about, right?

BRENNAN: "Yes."

MARISHA: Honestly, good kid.

BRENNAN: Dean Tallbarrel looks at you and hears you say the first nice thing you've said about Occtis. A minor Message cantrip comes from Ellipides to you and says, "You hate Occtis."

MARISHA: Shut up.

BRENNAN: Primus looks and says, "My house has arrived here in Dol-Makjar for the events of the execution of the criminal who attacked our guards in the marketplace. I had hoped to entreat with my son, who I'm given to understand has somehow worked out a way to acquire the gifts of shadow in the Realms Beyond that his own constitution was either too weak or sclerotic to arrive at under normal means?"

MARISHA: The back of Murray's head is just on fire and she's chewing on the inside of her mouth, almost to the point of where it's starting to bleed a little bit as a way to quite literally bite her tongue so that she does not make a massive mistake. What was it, Primus? Can I call you Primus?

BRENNAN: "Yes."

MARISHA: I don't want to be (laughs) indecent.

BRENNAN: "You would like to call me Primus, my first name, even though you are a ragamuffin and a commoner?"

MARISHA: Oh my god, thank you so much. I haven't been called a ragamuffin since my early 20s. Yes, that's the thing. That's what we actually believe here in the Penteveral is that despite anyone's status, they can rise above what they were born into, whether it be wealth or poverty and actually make something of themself and regardless of what I think about your family, I've got to give credit where credit is due. Occtis did just that.

BRENNAN: "Hmm."

MARISHA: But, you know, I haven't seen Occtis. It's actually funny, I'd forgotten about him a little bit. I haven't seen him in some time.

BRENNAN: I'm going to need you to give me a wisdom saving throw.

MARISHA: (gasps)

BRENNAN: 21. The Lord Primus doesn't do anything but you feel a cold settle upon you as his gaze descends and feel yourself repel a powerful curse that alights on you. Had you not been able to resist the spell, you would have spent a length of time unknown to you rolling a wisdom save at the beginning of every turn and if failing, not being able to take an action during that turn.

MARISHA: (pants)

BRENNAN: The spell feels like--

MARISHA: Flames on the side of my face.

BRENNAN: Ice cold.

MARISHA: Uh-huh. Murray--

BRENNAN: But you see there's no component, there's no spellcasting. He doesn't appear to be the one doing it.

MARISHA: I just run my tongue across the top of my teeth, give a few glances around. Look at Primus. Give him a little bit of a knowing nod. You know, I actually thought Occtis was with you all, maybe on vacation, whatever you rich people do. I thought you were in a lakefront property somehow, maybe up in the Sunset Mountains. You know, I'm actually from there. So if you ever want any recommendations, I got you. (laughs)

BRENNAN: "If you continue to speak to me, I'm going to kill you where you stand."

MARISHA: Okay, yeah, you know?

BRENNAN: Dean Tallbarrel says, "Aha, I think there's no problem at all. We can be finished here."

MARISHA: Can I even do, just knowing that something nefarious is happening here, can I pick at my teeth and do a little Detect Magic myself to see if I can sense where the source is coming from? But I don't want to--

BRENNAN: Do you want to give me a sleight of hand?

MARISHA: Sleight of Hand?

BRENNAN: A sleight of hand or a deception?

MARISHA: I'll do deception. If I fuck this up, this could be bad. I can feel it, I can feel it in my knees. Okay, okay.

BRENNAN: 14?

MARISHA: Mm-hmm. I got a hair, oh shit, sorry about that, Primus.

BRENNAN: Primus does not notice that you are doing this, but a 14 is not high enough to stop Ellipides, who goes, "Tea for everybody!" and pours tea and as he does, the teapot bursts into steam and he Counterspells your Detect Magic.

MARISHA: (gasp)

BRENNAN: "Ah, dang it, I spilled. Lord Tachonis, please, do you have?" You see the message that in your head just says, "Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go."

MARISHA: Uh-huh.

BRENNAN: Tachonis says, "You're a ridiculous man, Ellipides," and Ellipides says, "Ha ha. Well, that's why I'm resigning."

MARISHA: Clumsier than a blind badger, that one. Okay, it's nice meeting you, sir.

BRENNAN: "Bye, Murray." You see that he, as he walks out, you hear Primus saying, "That woman, I want you to fire her." You see that Dean Tallbarrel says, "Oh, I'll make sure to explain it to Kora. I don't have enough time with, but we'll make sure that actions are taken, Lord Tachonis, and I'll say as well, in terms of cursing her, what worse curse could there be than allowing a commoner to struggle with magic? (chuckle)" And he walks out. Give me insight, if you want.

OFFSCREEN: (laughs)

MARISHA: What, he-- (mock weeps) Fuck me, on my "fuck me, fuck you" die, so it's a one.

OFFSCREEN: Oh shit.

BRENNAN: Dean Tallbarrel has fundamentally betrayed you.

MARISHA: He's the worst! (frustrated groan)

BRENNAN: As you walk, you hear a voice saying, "Occtis must be retrieved at once. I would like the resources of your institution to bring my son to me. We are at Obrimus Manor in The Tanners."

MARISHA: Obermist?

BRENNAN: Obrimus.

MARISHA: Obrimus.

BRENNAN: Dean Tallbarrel says, "Of course. We'll find Occtis right away." Murray, leaving the room, what do you do?

MARISHA: These fucking rich bastards. I'm going to fucking take my school back. I'm going to take my school back. I'm going to fucking-- Azune, Azune! And I just--

BRENNAN: Take off?

MARISHA: But it's not like, her boobies are moving.

BRENNAN: (laughs)

MARISHA: She is power-walking to Azune.

BRENNAN: Power-walking to Azune as swiftly as your feet can carry you and somewhere in the city, Occtis Tachonis, much searched-for, has rolled initiative.

MARISHA: I got to fucking find this kid.

BRENNAN: Go ahead and get up.

MARISHA: Where's this fucking little weasel? (cheering) (clapping)

OFFSCREEN: (laughs)

MARISHA: (laughs)

TRAVIS: First map coming out.

WHITNEY: Let's go. (cheering)

LAURA: Oh shit.

ROBBIE: Where are we at?

LAURA: First map.

ALEXANDER: There's only three of us.

ROBBIE: Only three of us?

LAURA: Yeah.

TRAVIS: ♪ Occtis is going to die ♪

ROBBIE: Why are there only three of us?

ALEXANDER: I don't know what's happening.

MARISHA: Occtis is going to die.

LAURA: Oh god.

MARISHA: Sad to hear he died.

ALEXANDER: If there's anyone who's going to go first.

LAURA: Is that my drink? Am I leaking?

ROBBIE: Right before a fight, "Am I leaking?"

ALEXANDER: "Am I leaking?"

LAURA: Am I leaking? What's happening? Why is it so wet?

ROBBIE: Two, three, two, this way.

ALEXANDER: Okay.

ROBBIE: Oh yeah.

ALEXANDER: I'm not nervous at all. No, I didn't hear anything.

LAURA: I feel like I'm going to pee. (chuckles)

ROBBIE: (chuckles)

ROBBIE: Oh boy, I'm last in line.

ALEXANDER: I've got so much room.

LAURA: That's right. I rolled a 25.

ALEXANDER: I got 21.

BRENNAN: Occtis.

ALEXANDER: (nervous bleat)

BRENNAN: Thimble.

LAURA: Yeah.

ALEXANDER: I have a guy.

LAURA: That's right, a burlap sack was being thrown over my body.

BRENNAN: That's right.

ROBBIE: Oh boy.

BRENNAN: Da da da.

ALEXANDER: Christ.

BRENNAN: Kattigan, you're right here with Wulfric.

ALEXANDER: I-- oh.

BRENNAN: Hell yes. Da, da, da.

ALEXANDER: That's--

BRENNAN: Okay, we're going to go...

LAURA: (tongue waggles)

ALEXANDER: (pants) I'm so stressed.

BRENNAN: I'm so stressed.

LAURA: People are coming for you. Stay in the back.

ROBBIE: Okay, wait.

LAURA: What, what'd you do? What'd you forget?

ROBBIE: Now I'm missing my two sheets. It's all good.

BRENNAN: Hold on one second, gang. Okay. Da, da, da. Okay. You see that-- We arrive in the midst of combat. Thimble, this is The Guard Tower. It is the home base of the Crow Keepers. There are some servant rogues abound. This one has come up right behind you with a burlap sack whistling in the air. We have our initiative order locked and loaded and with this, we are going to move into initiative. Da, da, da. Ba, ba, ba. Okay. We're going to move into initiative and Thimble, hearing the whistling of the sack behind you, you see about 10 feet in front of you is Solomon, who's one of the guildmasters of the Crow Keepers.

LAURA: Who I was talking to.

BRENNAN: Who you were talking to. You mentioned Casimir to him. As you did so, you see that this is the rogue who set up behind you here with a burlap sack. Incredibly, even though they're going for you, nobody gets the jump on Thimble. So you actually are going to go first in this fight. It is your turn on a 25 initiative. Is there anything you want to do before taking any actions in combat? Any perception checks, anything else like that that you want to do before we jump into it?

LAURA: I can do that even though this is coming at me?

BRENNAN: Even though this is coming right at you.

LAURA: I mean! How many people are in this room right now?

BRENNAN: In this room, give me a perception check.

LAURA: Okay. I don't see shit.

BRENNAN: Okay. In this case, you know that there were two at the door when you came in and you're talking to a guy and someone's right behind you.

LAURA: All right.

BRENNAN: So four plus.

LAURA: I hear the whistle of the (laughs). There's a couple people.

BRENNAN: There's a couple people.

LAURA: Okay, I hear the whistle of the bag and I am going to fly backwards.

BRENNAN: Cool.

LAURA: Straight into the guy that is trying to come down. So I'm going.

BRENNAN: Hell yes. You're going to fly straight back into that person. So avoid the bag there. As you're going for that person, you also see that with the bag, you see that Solomon's standing in front of you. These other people here are standing up, but you see do not have weapons drawn right now. As you fly backwards, what do you do in this moment? What action do you take, are you attacking that person or are you just trying to avoid getting in the bag?

LAURA: I don't want to get in a fight with the entire Crow Keepers. It doesn't seem like a smart move in this moment.

BRENNAN: Why? There's three of you, and a wolf.

LAURA: (indecisive groan) (dramatic groan)

BRENNAN: I'll go ahead and say, you took your perception, give me an insight check.

LAURA: Okay. Okay.

ALEXANDER: Okay.

LAURA: Listen, this has got to be better. That's 15.

BRENNAN: No weapons drawn. This can break a lot of different ways. They escalated. You said a name and they leapt into action. But also you guys are running pretty ragged. You're here. In the past, you and Thjazi would've come here together. You're now here alone, Thjazi just died. It's also a tense time in the city. These new arcane laws just got passed. So you coming in and saying "Casimir," they're leaping into action. They don't know Kattigan, they don't know Occtis, right?

ALEXANDER: Occtis doesn't look like Occtis. He's a random man right now.

BRENNAN: So with all that being said, no weapons are out right now, but you don't think going in the bag is good.

LAURA: Okay.

BRENNAN: But in other words, everything's is on a fuse, but it could break a lot of ways right now.

LAURA: Okay, in that case, I'm going to fly backwards towards the guy and I'm going to fly down.

BRENNAN: Cool.

LAURA: Needles out and I'm going to get right up to his junk. I'm going to fly backwards and fly down to his legs and stick my needle into the pants and say, "Call your henchmen off or I chop off his balls!"

BRENNAN: Okay, this is going to be your action. In this case, with your action, I'm going to ask for an intimidate check.

LAURA: I didn't put any points in that, though!

BRENNAN: I know, and I am going to be mean and the difficulty is going to be 20.

ROBBIE: He's got tiny balls. (laughs)

ALEXANDER: He won't miss them.

LAURA: He's going to lose them then if he doesn't--

ALEXANDER: You picked the wrong guy.

LAURA: Okay. All right. All right. This one?

BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.

LAURA: No, no, no, no, no, so bad. (laughter)

LAURA: No, no. I rolled five. Five, is it?

BRENNAN: Gotcha. You rolled a five. You yell out, and give me your best thundering Thimble voice (laughs).

LAURA: Call off your henchmen or I slice off his balls!

BRENNAN: The guy right behind you, he gasps, he's not into this. You see Solomon says, "You're going to slice balls with a sewing needle? That'll take all day. Go for it." I'm going to need either a movement or bonus action from you.

LAURA: Oh, can I attack? I can't attack with a bonus action, can I?

BRENNAN: You can't attack with a bonus action.

LAURA: In that case, I'm going to go into his pants.

ALEXANDER: (snorts)

BRENNAN: Give me a hide, give me a hide check.

LAURA: (giggles)

ALEXANDER: (pants)

LAURA: Why am I rolling like this? (laughter) Okay. Wait, what am I doing, what is this? How do I roll for hide?

ALEXANDER: Stealth.

LAURA: Stealth, Jesus. Okay, look, it's a 14, it's not awful.

BRENNAN: It's not awful.

ALEXANDER: Oh my god.

BRENNAN: Let's see how good a 14 is. Hold on one sec. As you rush in, you see that rushing into this room, on a 14, you get into this guy's pants successfully. On a 14, it's bad in here.

LAURA: It isn't pleasant.

BRENNAN: It's bad. It's unpleasant. The wash of embarrassment and sort of apology of the thief whose pants you are in, as he's like, "Ah, I'm sorry." (laughter)

LAURA: Why did I choose the pants?!

BRENNAN: You leap into action here and as you do so, you hide on that 14. The next in the initiative order for us is going to be Occtis on a 21.

ALEXANDER: So Occtis sees you fly into his pants and sees your intimidation check completely not go off.

LAURA: No.

ALEXANDER: He goes: (grumbles) Okay. And looks at Solomon and says: I think maybe you should be a little more scared than you are. And casts Cause Fear on Solomon.

BRENNAN: Hell yes, let's do it.

ALEXANDER: It's only a vocal component, so I don't need to make any hand motions or anything to give myself away. He needs to make a wisdom 14--

LAURA: Get me out of this.

ALEXANDER: -- save.

BRENNAN: Gotcha, he's going to make a wisdom 14 saving throw. Here we go. With a 19 on the die.

ALEXANDER: Ugh.

LAURA: Fuck.

BRENNAN: He looks at you and says, "Oh, throwing a little bit of magic around? I don't need anything other than a knife to make you scared, my friend." And you see that the guy next to him flips a coin in the air, grabs it and goes, "What do you really look like?"

LAURA: (gasps)

BRENNAN: Any bonus action from Occtis?

ALEXANDER: I cry.

BRENNAN: Cry? (laughter)

ALEXANDER: No bonus actions. (off-screen laughter)

BRENNAN: I love it, that's great. With that, Kattigan, you are going to go.

ROBBIE: Okay. This is going great, guys.

LAURA: This is going really good.

ROBBIE: Really good, really good.

LAURA: Start us off.

ROBBIE: Where am I? There's like a man, did you have something?

ALEXANDER: No.

ROBBIE: Oh. Is that one of the henchmen over there by me by the bar?

BRENNAN: Over by the bar?

ROBBIE: Yeah, where am I?

BRENNAN: You're right here.

ROBBIE: Okay.

BRENNAN: You've got one right behind Thimble. There's two behind you over here and you can give me an insight or a perception, if you want.

ROBBIE: Hmm.

ALEXANDER: Just so I'm clear.

BRENNAN: Mm-hmm?

ALEXANDER: He said, "What do you really look like?" Did he do anything?

BRENNAN: No, no spells.

ALEXANDER: Okay, okay. No spells happened yet, great.

ROBBIE: Okay.

ALEXANDER: I just wanted to make sure it wasn't just me standing there.

ROBBIE: You're in the man's pants?

LAURA: I'm in the man's pants.

ROBBIE: He's just flipping a coin? I have no idea what that means.

LAURA: Just do it.

ROBBIE: (screams) I'm going to just jump over the bar, and no weapon, fisticuff the first guy in the room.

BRENNAN: Hell yeah. Leaping over the bar to the guy that Thimble's in his pants?

ROBBIE: Perfect.

BRENNAN: Okay, great.

ROBBIE: Yep.

LAURA: This is what he gets.

BRENNAN: You rush over to this dude here. Go ahead and give me an attack roll. You're just going fisticuffs, right?

ROBBIE: Yeah, yes. Actually, well yes, but I want to do it in a way, we'll see if it works. Oh, we are cooked, fam.

LAURA: Oh no. Are you rolling really bad, too?

ROBBIE: We're the worst!

LAURA: (laughs)

ALEXANDER: I'm a child.

LAURA: You're not a child, you're like 20!

ROBBIE: Two for an eight.

ALEXANDER: Hey, hey, hey. Listen to me, I've got to have an excuse.

LAURA: (laughs)

ROBBIE: My intention is to jump over and grab this man by the back of his lapels.

BRENNAN: Yeah.

ROBBIE: And I rolled an eight.

BRENNAN: You rolled an eight.

LAURA: Oh god.

BRENNAN: You rush him, he looks out. As you go for the back of his lapel, you see he bends down to open the inseam of his pants with his hands, rip it open as he goes "Get out of there!" to the fairy as you go (whoosh) and just bonk, go over the top, tumble ass over tea kettle in front of him. This is an auspicious first combat for Campaign 4.

LAURA: (laughs)

ALEXANDER: We're doing great, we can only go up.

BRENNAN: I don't know how to say this other than it's the rogues' turn.

LAURA: Oh god.

BRENNAN: This guy is going to make a grapple check for you. He is going to, I want to double-check here, if you have anything special about being grappled due to your small size. I don't believe so.

LAURA: I don't think so, I just have a high dex.

BRENNAN: You just have a high dex, okay. He is going to reach out. He's going to attempt to make an opposed athletics check.

LAURA: But I can use acrobatics.

BRENNAN: Yes, that's correct. You can use acrobatics. That's what it was. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So he's going to make an opposed athletics or acrobatics. He rolls-- (gasps)

LAURA: Did he roll a 20? What did he roll?

BRENNAN: He didn't roll a 20. He rolled an 18.

ALEXANDER: (exasperated sigh)

BRENNAN: So what do you need to roll to beat an 18?

LAURA: I need to roll-- to get a 19, I have to roll a 10.

BRENNAN: Okay.

LAURA: Or higher.

BRENNAN: Go ahead and roll.

LAURA: Okay. Okay!

BRENNAN: Here we go,

LAURA: Why? No, I didn't.

ALEXANDER: What is happening here?

LAURA: I'm rolling so wildly, I can't even get it in the box. I'm just going to see if I would've rolled in the box, what it would've been. (off-screen laughter)

LAURA: It was worse. (off-screen laughter)

LAURA: Don't kill us, we haven't even started!

ALEXANDER: I have so much to live for. (laughter)

BRENNAN: So the first rogue reaches into his pants--

LAURA: Help.

BRENNAN: -- his ruined pants, grabs Thimble, and shoves you in a bag and pulls the drawstring closed.

LAURA: Fuck!

ROBBIE: Oh man.

BRENNAN: Blam.

ALEXANDER: Oh god.

BRENNAN: And then (laughter) Hey gang, tough, this is tough.

ALEXANDER: Oh god. Okay.

LAURA: Okay.

ROBBIE: Ah, yeah, yeah, sure.

LAURA: Listen.

ROBBIE: Yeah, we're good.

BRENNAN: You guys are good. Here we go. So.

LAURA: This is how I wanted it to go. This is how we get into the--

ALEXANDER: This is all part of the plan?

ROBBIE: Yeah, yeah.

BRENNAN: These guys are so unbothered that they are not going to fight. The guildmasters just sit there.

LAURA: This is so pathetic.

BRENNAN: These three rush you. This guy just took care of Thimble. We'll move Thimble off the board momentarily because they're in a bag. These two. Five, 10, 15, 20, 25 are going to close.

ALEXANDER: Your wolf.

BRENNAN: Oh, Kattigan, you're-- but no, yeah, yeah, yeah.

ROBBIE: I passed, yeah.

ALEXANDER: Okay.

BRENNAN: These two rush up here and these are going to rush down the stairs.

LAURA: Game's over, fellas, we lost D&D. (laughter)

ALEXANDER: You know, this is my fault. I don't practice D&D a lot, I do other games. (laughter)

BRENNAN: So, two of them are going to attempt to basically bind Wulfric with binds. I'm going to need two opposed athletics checks from Wulfric.

ROBBIE: Okay.

LAURA: Roll higher.

ROBBIE: Did you roll a nat 20 already?

BRENNAN: I just hit a nat 20.

ROBBIE: Yeah.

LAURA: Jesus Christ.

BRENNAN: I'm so sorry.

ROBBIE: It's okay, nothing will happen.

BRENNAN: Okay. So Wulfric is pinned.

ROBBIE: Sure.

BRENNAN: I'm going to roll in front of the board to prove that this is not pre-planned to go this badly. I'm going to roll in front of the board for the next one. Wulfric is already pinned, so this is going to be with advantage to tie up Wulfric.

ROBBIE: Oh my gosh.

BRENNAN: That's an 18, which is just a flat 18.

ROBBIE: (sigh) No, 16.

BRENNAN: 16. Two of these Crow Keepers leap on the wolf, throw him to the side and get rope around his legs, just hogtying this wolf. Another three are going to, the others take their turn to get downstairs. Three of them are coming for Kattigan at the same time. No weapons drawn, they're just using fists and knees.

LAURA: (laughs) Rub it in.

ALEXANDER: You're saying this like it's supposed to make us feel better, but it just makes me feel worse. "They don't have any weapons." And I'm like: Yeah, I know.

LAURA: Do something.

BRENNAN: That's a hit.

LAURA: Okay.

BRENNAN: So they're only dealing two points of damage with fists and knees but they're adding sneak attack to that.

ROBBIE: Okay, sure.

BRENNAN: Seven points of damage to Kattigan as a fist connects under the ribs.

ROBBIE: (grunts)

BRENNAN: Solomon looks at you and says, "My condolences for your loss." To the bag, "As for you, I don't know who the fuck you are, so you're just going to die." The window shatters, you turn, and an elven warrior leaps into the tavern. Ashley Johnson, would you come out to the table and join us?

LAURA: Oh my god.

ROBBIE: Save us!

LAURA: Save us, save us, Ashley Johnson!

BRENNAN: Hey, Ash, I hope you're rolling hot!

LAURA: I think, though, we got our information--

ASHLEY: Oh, heller.

LAURA: Because I think the Crow Keepers suck.

ALEXANDER: Yeah, I think we're not friends with them anymore.

ASHLEY: Okay.

ALEXANDER: Okay.

ASHLEY: Oh god, that was bad.

ALEXANDER: Yeah.

LAURA: Roll so good.

ALEXANDER: So good please.

ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to roll so good. I'm going to roll so good right now. It's all happening. It's all going to come together.

LAURA: Do you remember how before the game, you and I were rolling and it was like nat 20, nat 20 and I was like--

ROBBIE: I said, "Don't waste them."

LAURA: "We're going to roll like shit."

ROBBIE: Yeah, of course.

ALEXANDER: Why'd you do that?

LAURA: I don't know.

ASHLEY: Okay.

BRENNAN: Incredible. Vaelus, so this is like, you guys are some rough-and-tumble rowdies, to the Crow Keepers, a creature of myth and legend, an elf from the far north, fully armored, veil of mourning religious garb. You crash through the window, you can crash through whatever window you want. Do you want to be over here, do you want to be behind these guys?

ASHLEY: Okay, where is everybody? Oh, I see.

BRENNAN: This guy's got Thimble in a bag. Occtis is here. These two rogues just bound Wulfric. In the center of the tavern, Kattigan's got his fists up.

LAURA: I've got to get different weapons.

BRENNAN: Kattigan's got his fists up, and three of the Crow Keepers are just sucker punching, kidney punching. Again, there's no lethal weapons here, but rogues, when they do that melee attack, can add their sneak attack damage to it. So they hit fucking hard.

ASHLEY: All right. I think I'm going to come through this window over here.

BRENNAN: Okay.

ALEXANDER: So right behind me.

ASHLEY: So I see somebody. Do I clock that this is Occtis?

BRENNAN and ALEXANDER: No.

ASHLEY: No, okay. So the only person that I really recognize in this room right now is Kattigan?

BRENNAN: That is correct, you recognize Kattigan.

ASHLEY: Okay.

BRENNAN: I'll say this: give me a perception check.

ASHLEY: Okay.

LAURA: Are you following us? Can you hear wings drumming?

ASHLEY: I was following.

BRENNAN: Yeah, you know they're in there. Oh yeah, sorry, you followed them the whole time.

ASHLEY: I followed them the whole time.

BRENNAN: You know that's Occtis, and I think that bag is glowing slightly.

ASHLEY: Great, okay. So I am going towards the person that I see holding the glowing bag.

BRENNAN: Hell yeah. Okay, you go to the person that you see holding the glowing bag. Rushing along the bar top, you close another What do you want to do?

ASHLEY: Okay, I want to-- she moves so lightly and quietly and undoes her censer whip.

BRENNAN: Okay.

ASHLEY: And I'm going to take the whip and take it around the back of my neck and roll it all the way around for propulsion and at the end of the censer, there's little blades in the censer.

LAURA: Nice.

BRENNAN: Yeah.

ASHLEY: So I want to chuck it right into his cheek.

BRENNAN: Hell yeah, give me an attack roll.

ASHLEY: Okay. Okay, okay, which one do I pick?

LAURA: (laughs) Which one to pick?

ASHLEY: Because we need some help right now. I'm feeling like this one is going to do well.

LAURA: Your one that-- okay.

ASHLEY: I could read it, for starters.

BRENNAN: For starters.

ALEXANDER: (laughs)

ASHLEY: It's so bad. Better than a one, but it is a two, which takes me to a seven.

LAURA: Oh lord.

BRENNAN: Copy that.

ASHLEY: Fucking piece of shit.

ALEXANDER: What is happening?

ROBBIE: (muffled) Oh no.

BRENNAN: With that--

ASHLEY: I leave. (laughter)

ROBBIE: What an entrance, though.

BRENNAN: I promise this is not a consolation prize, we are not currently adjusting for the fact that Kattigan is on the direct opposite side of that figure. So for flanking purposes, you do have advantage.

LAURA: Please, please.

ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. I knew I should have picked this one anyway, I felt it.

BRENNAN: For all of you, complicated battle setup here, but the reason we use minis is for strategy.

ALEXANDER: Yes!

ASHLEY: Oh, oh, natural 20!

BRENNAN: Natural 20!

ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay!

ASHLEY: I'm not rolling on here anymore. That's what the problem was. Okay, so--

ROBBIE: You got it fixed now.

ASHLEY: Actually, I'm going to roll in here because it's a little less quiet.

LAURA: Oh my god.

BRENNAN: Cool.

ASHLEY: More quiet. Okay, so--

ALEXANDER: Jesus Christ.

ASHLEY: So that means it hit.

LAURA: I was just crying because I was celebrating so hard.

ASHLEY: All right, so for starters, that is five points of damage.

BRENNAN: So you're rolling that, but you're going to double that because that was a nat 20.

ASHLEY: That is correct, because I rolled a natural 20.

BRENNAN: So that's five.

ASHLEY: Oh five, so 10.

LAURA: 10.

BRENNAN: 10, and then you're adding your ability modifier, which in the case of the whip, is this your dexterity or your strength?

ASHLEY: This- is- my-- hang on. (laughter)

BRENNAN: You got this.

ASHLEY: Wait, wait, sorry, sorry. Where am I?

ROBBIE: 800 years of knowledge. (laughter)

ASHLEY: I'm so old, I can't remember.

BRENNAN: It's our first combat. We're running these bad boys for the very first time.

ASHLEY: Actually, there is not one.

ALEXANDER: That's right.

ASHLEY: It's just 1d8.

LAURA: There's no add?

BRENNAN: Oh, that's right. You add plus three.

ASHLEY: I'm adding that as well. Okay, sorry, so--

BRENNAN: That's 13 points.

ASHLEY: 13 points of damage. But also, I would like to Divine Smite as a bonus action. Am I allowed to do this?

BRENNAN: You are, but I will say this right now. Before you Divine Smite, on 13 points of damage, before you even need summon the spell to your call, you hit this guy for and he flies to the ground unconscious. So Vaelus, you leap forward, (whoosh) bam. (grunt) The bag flies open. Thimble, you tumble out onto the ground as this Crow Keeper goes down and is unconscious. I would ask this. Vaelus, are you--

LAURA: And his dick's out because he took his pants off, ha!

ASHLEY: Ha ha ha ha.

BRENNAN: Are you striking to kill in this moment or just striking to wound?

ASHLEY: To kill.

BRENNAN: Yeah, hell yeah. You leap up, this guy's got Thimble in a bag. You (whooshes) (grunts) head to the side and these city thieves and pickpockets watch as an ancient elven warrior who beheld the death of the last god slashes the throat open of one of their compatriots and he hits the ground, dead.

ALEXANDER: Shit.

BRENNAN: As he falls, that's your action, any bonus actions from you?

ASHLEY: Bonus action, I'm going to look around to see who is trying to make their next move and I want to Divine Smite.

BRENNAN: Hell yes. Your Divine Smite in this moment, I'll say this. Divine Smite only can be added to an attack. I just didn't want you to waste the spell slot on this dude here.

ASHLEY: I understand. Okay, so you know what? Actually, is there a way that I could, since I yanked the censer out while slashing his throat--

BRENNAN: Yeah.

ASHLEY: That I can, with that, pick up the bag of Thimble, chuck it up and try to catch it?

BRENNAN: Hell yes, absolutely. Give me sleight of hand.

ASHLEY: Okay.

LAURA: But I'm out on the ground already?

BRENNAN: You've tumbled out, but you're prone.

ASHLEY: Oh, you're tumbled out?

BRENNAN: Yeah. She's prone, she's all good.

LAURA: I'm good. Not freaking out--

ASHLEY: Sorry, there's so much happening, it's a blur.

LAURA: At all.

BRENNAN: So much happening.

ALEXANDER: So much performance that'll make you think we're not good.

LAURA: I don't get scared ever. (smirks)

BRENNAN: For your bonus action, I believe the bonus actions that you have available to you, you have Hunter's Mark, you also have Shield of Faith, which is one of your abilities.

ASHLEY: Oh yes, I have Hunter's Mark.

BRENNAN: You have Hunter's Mark.

LAURA: Oh.

ASHLEY: Okay. I chose that for you.

LAURA: Aww.

ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to Hunter's Mark...

LAURA: Solomon.

ASHLEY: Solomon!

BRENNAN: What does this look like in this moment as you Hunter's Mark him? He turns to you. He thought this was going to be, we're going to rough you up and toss you in the bag and a mythical elf surged through a window and immediately killed someone with a weapon he's never seen before. He looks at you, genuinely frightened in this moment.

ASHLEY: You just see Vaelus' eyes go completely black just for a split second and he just feels, it feels like heartburn, but he doesn't know what it is.

BRENNAN: Next to him, the guy who flipped the coin looks, he goes "(gasp) The evil eye." (laughter)

ALEXANDER: Seeing Solomon completely in fear of you, I go: That's what I was trying to do. (laughter)

BRENNAN: Incredible. That is Vaelus' turn. We go back to Thimble at the top of the order.

LAURA: Oh, you guys are fucked now. I tried to warn you. You guys are so fucked. I'm going to fly up in the air and I'm going to spread my wings out of my arms and fairy dust is going to fly out in all directions from me and I'm going to Faerie Fire the room.

ALEXANDER: Ooh.

BRENNAN: Hell yes, awesome. As you Faerie Fire the room, (zaps) is that pixie dust, what does that look like as we see that?

LAURA: That is glowing dust which always comes out of me, scatters around, it's bright spring green-gold sparkles everywhere.

BRENNAN: Hell yes.

LAURA: Coating everyone except for who I don't want it to.

BRENNAN: Incredible. Okay, this guy next to Solomon succeeds, but Solomon fails on the Faerie Fire check and the other rogues are all going to roll. Da, da, da. Hell yeah. Wow, bad rolls. Okay. Three of them that came from the stairs get out of the way in time, but everybody fighting Kattigan around here fails. So there's advantage on all of these guys right in front of you. That is your action, any bonus action from you?

LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to dart up and hide in the rafters.

BRENNAN: Hell yeah. (swooshes) Flying up into the rafters of the tavern, you get out of range of any melee weapons and can actually get half cover as you're up there hiding in the rafters. That is going to be Occtis.

ALEXANDER: Seeing, in his head hyping himself up. He's like: You got this. You can do this, you've done this before. (deep breath) And is going to look at Solomon and still attempting to keep his adult voice--

LAURA: You are an adult! (laughter)

ALEXANDER: Don't blow my cover. Just says: What does a dagger do against fire? And Fire Bolts straight at him.

BRENNAN: You will make this attack roll with advantage.

ALEXANDER: I'll make this attack roll with it and I'm not using any DC modifiers. Okay. The fire starts building around his hand, but it's not orange and red. It is this sickly green fire that starts wrapping around his arm as he rears his hand back. Wow, double 11s, wild. That is a 17 to hit.

BRENNAN: 17 hits.

ALEXANDER: Okay.

BRENNAN: Go ahead and roll damage.

ASHLEY: Yes. Yes!

ALEXANDER: Now where the hell's my dice?

ASHLEY: You have so many dice.

ALEXANDER: I have so many dice, leave me alone. That's so bad. That is three points of fire damage.

BRENNAN: (sizzles) Singed by this fire, Solomon flies back in this moment. He is looking extremely perturbed. Even though you see that he manages to dodge most of the fire, he thought he was going to be counting money this morning and instead one of his Crow Keepers is dead and he just had magical fire thrown at him. Not a great morning for him. Any bonus action?

ALEXANDER: I have no bonus actions to use, but I will use my movement to jump up on the bar behind Vaelus and as I do, just go: Oh my god, thank you for being here. (laughter)

ASHLEY: Well, hello. You're a bit young to be in this fight. Where is your mother?

ALEXANDER: I'm an adult.

BRENNAN: "I promise I'm an adult." As you leap up to there, Kattigan, that's going to be your turn.

ROBBIE: Sure. (grunt) These guys don't have me grappled, they're just still punching on me?

BRENNAN: Still punching on you.

ROBBIE: Okay, cool. I'm going to take an attack on the closest guy in the middle.

BRENNAN: Hell yeah.

ROBBIE: Does that get advantage on it?

BRENNAN: You have advantage on it.

LAURA: You got it, yeah.

ROBBIE: Okay, cool. (grunts) Going to need it.

LAURA: Oh.

ROBBIE: Okay.

LAURA: Good.

ROBBIE: Thank goodness.

ALEXANDER: Yeah, we just needed to work out the kinks.

LAURA: Yeah.

ROBBIE: Yeah, we're getting there. 25.

ASHLEY: We use that one.

BRENNAN: 25 to hit, that is a hit. Go ahead, and you're still going with your fists?

ROBBIE: I want to pull my weapon out.

BRENNAN: Okay.

ROBBIE: I think it's time.

BRENNAN: Yeah, let's go for it.

LAURA: Now we're pissed.

ROBBIE: Now we're pissed, well yeah. He looks down at the dead guy that Vaelus just merc'd and goes: First blood, all right! Then from behind his back, he pulls out this thing and at first glance, it looks like a club, but it's not quite a club. It's got a stone knot on the side, but on the back is this horrific Damascus steel-looking blade, and there's a notch that you can't quite figure out. It doesn't look right and it's definitely something cobbled together, crafted together and well-loved, and he's going to flip it over to the bludgeoning side and grab it with both hands and-- Not great, but fine. Nine, no, sorry, that's a 10 because it's that-- No, it's still nine, nine points of bludgeoning damage.

BRENNAN: You reach out and crack this guy across the skull (cracks) as he stumbles back, blood gushing down his face, covered in pixie dust. All three of them are coughing, (coughs, sputters) glitter falling out of their mouths. Nine points of damage. He hollers back, any bonus actions from you?

ROBBIE: As a bonus action, can I have Wulfric try to break the pin?

BRENNAN: Yes, go ahead. With the pin here, it's a DC 18 athletics check.

ROBBIE: Okay, and I use his, is it a saving throw, or--?

BRENNAN: Athletics.

ROBBIE: Athletics, okay. Do I use mine? Oh, no, that's tough. I don't have my little sheet.

BRENNAN: Let me see if I can pull that up for you. Hold on one second. As you jump forward, go ahead and roll. Let's see what he gets here.

ROBBIE: The straight roll is a 12.

BRENNAN: Okay.

ROBBIE: Don't think it'll do it.

BRENNAN: Probably not going to get a plus six here.

ROBBIE: Yeah.

BRENNAN: But let's just double-check. Da, da, da. Unfortunately, no, it adds a plus two to that.

ROBBIE: Two, okay.

BRENNAN: You see (snarls) struggling against the bonds there on that bonus action. It goes back to Vaelus. Vaelus, it is your turn once more. Give me an insight check, if you'd be so kind.

ASHLEY: Yes, I will. Okay.

LAURA: (exasperated groan)

ALEXANDER: Sweating.

ASHLEY: 14.

BRENNAN: On a 14, looking throughout this place, one man lies dead. Thimble is free, Occtis is up behind you. The wolf is bound here. You know that this is your last action before these Crow Keepers get back on their footing. On a 14, these are petty criminals. They don't look like they want to all die here in this tavern. But also they don't know what they're facing. They don't know if you're a fucking ghost or an avenging demon or something like that and I think that you have a turn before they act. It's an extremely dicey move either way. They look panicked, which means that they might fight to the death. But also these are not, you can tell, you've fought warriors. These are not warriors.

ASHLEY: I don't care about these people.

BRENNAN: Great.

ASHLEY: So I would like to just keep killing.

BRENNAN: Great.

LAURA: (laughs) Jeez.

ALEXANDER: I'm so scared right now.

BRENNAN: You've Hunter's Marked the guildmaster right here.

ASHLEY: That is the guildmaster and that's Solomon?

BRENNAN: That's him, yeah.

ASHLEY: So knowing that that's him, I am going to look his way.

BRENNAN: Yeah.

ASHLEY: I'm going to cast Guiding Bolt.

BRENNAN: Hell yeah.

ASHLEY: That just happens.

BRENNAN: That just literally happens. You have advantage on this.

ASHLEY: Okay.

BRENNAN: ♪ Ta, ta, ta ♪ You have advantage on this, so roll, I believe--

ASHLEY: Wait.

ALEXANDER: Yeah.

ASHLEY: I do roll.

ALEXANDER: Yeah, you have a plus six, yeah. And advantage.

ASHLEY: Come on, come on, come on. Okay, that's pretty good. Okay.

BRENNAN: Dirty 20, that is a hit.

ASHLEY: Great.

BRENNAN: So you are going to, I believe that Hunter's Mark, you hit it with an attack roll, so you can also add 1d6.

ASHLEY: Another d6, okay.

BRENNAN: Another d6, that's correct.

ASHLEY: All right.

BRENNAN: So it should be 5d6.

ASHLEY: Oh, okay. That's pretty good.

ALEXANDER: Oh my god.

ASHLEY: All right, so we've got

BRENNAN: Goddamn.

ROBBIE: (impressed whistle)

LAURA: Holy moly.

ASHLEY: I feel like the Guiding Bolt, if you do see it, it's just black, dark energy.

BRENNAN: Hell yes. Vaelus, you believe in something that's been dead for a long time, and what used to be green and growing is now as dark as midnight and it surges forward from you, slams into Solomon's chest for 18 points of damage and he shudders back, falls to the ground dead.

LAURA: (gasps)

BRENNAN: (death gasp) (thud)

ASHLEY: I walk right over to him.

BRENNAN: You step over, he is dead. You see the chill of death moves out over all of the Crow Keepers here in this moment. You still have a bonus action.

ASHLEY: I'm going to start swinging my censer and look at the rest of them. Run.

BRENNAN: Give me intimidation with advantage.

ASHLEY: Okay.

BRENNAN: You just blew a hole with magic in his chest. We're going to call this straight up, I'll say a difficulty 10 gets some of them.

ASHLEY: Okay.

BRENNAN: Difficulty 15 gets everybody in the fucking room.

ASHLEY: Great. Okay.

ALEXANDER: Yeah.

ASHLEY: So 17 plus four. Yes.

BRENNAN: 21. Vaelus whispers, "Run," and these petty criminals make for every door and window in the place and begin to bolt as fast as they can.

LAURA: Can I jump out of hiding and come down and fly right in front of the guy with the coin?

BRENNAN: Yes, you can.

LAURA: Right before he leaves and go: Not you!

BRENNAN: He turns to you. As you get the needle in front of him, he stops but he looks and says-- You can tell he will take a needle in the eye to not disobey the command that Vaelus just gave. He looks to you, if he should continue running with one less eye.

ASHLEY: No, please stay.

LAURA: We need him, Vaelus.

BRENNAN: (laughs)

BRENNAN: As he does so, we come out of combat as all of the rogues flee except for this last one with the coin.

ASHLEY: Can I take my whip around the bottom of his ankles and make him sit?

BRENNAN: You (whip lashes out), he slams into a chair in front of you.

ASHLEY: He's all yours.

LAURA: Fuck. Well.

ALEXANDER: Get off the bar.

LAURA: If they didn't hate us before. (laughs) I'm looking for Casimir.

BRENNAN: "Casimir's gone. Casimir's gone."

LAURA: When did he leave?

ALEXANDER: What kind of gone?

BRENNAN: He says, "Cas has been on the gibbet for a moment. That's our list of people who have owed money for long enough that they're not going to survive the next new moon. We found out that Cas had been skimming off the top for a while. We figured out how much money he owed. He worked at a place called Underwallen & Sisters. They were a wainwright that worked in the Embers, they made wagons. He worked putting compartments in the wagons, places that shouldn't be there, ran a racket off the smugglers there."

LAURA: Yeah.

BRENNAN: "But knowing what he knew, he'd been hitting some of the people that had been coming because he knew that there were going to be things hidden in those compartments he built and rather than taking a flat fee, he thought he might help himself every once in a while. He'd recognize his own handiwork, started taking where he shouldn't. All well and good, we've all got to make a living, but he got greedy. He didn't report back to," and he gestures over to Solomon. He says "He didn't report back to Sol. So we tabulated his debt, told him he had a certain amount of time to get back to us, to make everything right, and (sighs) he made it all right yesterday."

LAURA: Did he tell you guys about the hideout? Were you there?

BRENNAN: "I wasn't there. I didn't know. Cas had his own crew, four or five Crow Keepers that were loyal to him. I didn't know anything. The last thing we would've done is, frankly, fuck with someone as connected as Thjazi."

LAURA: Can I think back to the attack, did any of the masked figures look as big as Casimir? Motherfucker.

BRENNAN: "Cas came in here yesterday and settled his debts in full. We told him if he could pay off even half of it, that we would extend, we'd take him off the gibbet until he could make it right. He owed more money than-- You can't let people walk around owing you that amount of money, but we were understanding. We try to do business in this town over a long time, you understand? He came in yesterday. Him and his crew had new gear. He dropped a sack of money on the bar, paid off his whole debt, and he had a deed of title to a stronghouse in Gormalay. He said he was getting out of town. Right after that– You know that, it wasn't a Crow Keeper, but he knew someone, it was a Nama."

LAURA: Cyd.

BRENNAN: "Cyd barged in, started shouting at him. Cyd had worked up a lather, his fur was matted. He'd been sweating, looked like he'd run here from Marud or wherever. I know he drives wagons for the Revolutionary Council up there. He came in screaming about, 'Where's the wagon? 'We're already too late.' He saw the money on the table and Cyd grabbed that deed of title and ran out the door and Cas and his boys took after him. That's the last we saw Cas."

LAURA: I thought Cyd might've been in league with him.

ALEXANDER: I guess not.

LAURA: We have to tell Teor.

ALEXANDER: Yeah. That means they sold it, right?

LAURA: The stone?

ALEXANDER: Yeah.

LAURA: Your stone.

ASHLEY: It's probably where they got all that money.

ALEXANDER: Yeah.

LAURA: That and everything else in there.

BRENNAN: "You're talking about a stone?"

LAURA: Don't worry about it.

ASHLEY: Does it sound familiar to you?

BRENNAN: "I think Cas had been on the low end for a long time. There's a look people start to get in their eyes when they just can't take losing anymore. I don't know what he took or who he crossed. Clearly," you see he looks at his dead guildmaster next to him, "Clearly, Cas has crossed some very dangerous people. You'll have no trouble from the Crow Keepers. But he's gone, and I don't know what he got his hands on to walk in with the gear he had. He's moved up in the world and out of Dol-Makjar, or that was the plan before Cyd ran off."

LAURA: We have to get back to Teor. We have to get to Gormlay?

BRENNAN: "Gormalay."

LAURA: That's where they're heading.

BRENNAN: "Gormalay, it's north in Timmony."

LAURA: That's right.

ROBBIE: You said Timmony?

BRENNAN: "That's right." You see that he looks and says, "You've made your point. You've drawn blood."

LAURA: This wasn't the intention. I am sorry about your boss.

BRENNAN: "Wasn't you who drew first blood." You see he looks over and says, "We handle our own, but we understand when the waters run deeper than we had first anticipated. I don't know what happened to cross you, my lady, but whatever forces you represent, they'll receive no trouble from the Crow Keepers. Cas meddled in magics that perhaps he shouldn't have. All lessons learned."

LAURA: Do you know where he might have sold? Do you have a contact, somebody he worked with mostly?

BRENNAN: "Cas was on a list of people that were not long for this world on our account. He had scammed his way into an early grave on our behalf. But the kind of people that can pay that kind of gold in that short amount of time, I think Cas had been at the end of his rope for a while and he saw an opportunity."

LAURA: We don't need anything else from you. Let's go.

ALEXANDER: This whole time, Pin has been gnawing at the bindings on Wulfric to try and untie the wolf.

BRENNAN: Gnawing at them, you see he turns around and I think gnawing away, Wulfric (snarls) comes undone from the bindings. With that, where do you all head at this moment?

LAURA: Do we have any idea where Teor would've gone? Because we need to tell him about Cyd.

BRENNAN: The only place you know, Thimble, that Teor-- You don't know where he was staying with Loza but you know that he would know eventually to head back to Hal's.

LAURA: Then we should go back to Hal's, yeah?

ALEXANDER: We go back there.

ROBBIE: If we're going to Timmony, we'll need everyone we can get.

LAURA: Are you in?

ROBBIE: Am I what?

LAURA: Are you in to make Casimir pay?

ROBBIE: Yeah.

LAURA: Good man.

ROBBIE: Ow.

LAURA: My tiny little fist.

BRENNAN: (laughs)

ASHLEY: I have a question.

BRENNAN: Yeah?

ASHLEY: The Crow Keepers have a list--

BRENNAN: Yeah.

ASHLEY: -- of people who have--

LAURA: I'm really fucking strong.

BRENNAN: Who owe them money.

LAURA: No, I'm not.

ASHLEY: Okay. Before we go, what is your name?

BRENNAN: "Me? Oh. Gavrey."

ASHLEY: Gavrey, do you have-- Would it be possible to receive a copy of that list?

BRENNAN: "The gibbet?"

ASHLEY: Yeah.

BRENNAN: "You want a list of-- These are people whose character falls beneath the standard of a thieves' guild. You want a list of those names?"

ASHLEY: Just to see, just a little peeksies.

BRENNAN: He pulls a little ledger book out, looks at it, reaches into the pocket of dead guildmaster next to him, pulls out a similar ledger, tosses it to you.

ASHLEY: Thank you.

BRENNAN: "I hope I never see you again."

ASHLEY: I hope the same.

BRENNAN: You all leave, and that's where we'll take our break.

Break
Part II
BRENNAN: Everyone says stuff right before we come back and they're all in trouble and I'm keeping a tally, and the tally's running. Tick-tock, all of you motherfuckers.

AABRIA: I didn't say anything.

TALIESIN: If everyone's awful, no one is.

TRAVIS: Tattletale.

AABRIA: He's a snitch.

BRENNAN: At the very bottom of the cascading falls of Dol-Makjar where the River Vrosh lets out into Lake Nahami, as the city and its tall, spiraling towers begins to fade into the nearby woods, and the highway taking off to neighboring towns, deeper into the land of Kahad, we see here at the base, the tall spires of Dol-Makjar, this city that was the shield of Kahad during long centuries that stood as the shields to the orcish homeland against the mountain dwarves to their east, to the humans to their north, at a time ruled by the Shapers. Now it beholds a metropolis, a place where all peoples united in revolution and rebellion against the gods, can sing and trade, dance and perform magic. And when we speak of perform, place of performance, at the very base of that city, surrounded by the woods at the very edge, we see an ancient place with a brand new wooden sign leaning against a massive stone entranceway, and we see some boots approaching that sign. And Liam, what does it say on that sign that now waits with so much potential there by the wall?

LIAM: Oh, with lumber still off to the side in a pile, the sign reads, "The Hallowed Round." A pun.

BRENNAN: Before you, you see an ancient dithyramb, an amphitheater. This place can fit thousands, it is truly enormous, and at its center there is a stage, and that stage, ancient stone, you see there's some ruins and collapsing around, you see various members of your theater troupe, that as you approach with Thaisha and Shadia, call out, "Hey, Hal!" As hammer (pounding), wood putting stuff up. You see some tarps covering some things outside. And I'd like you to describe, if you can, any of the environs, and also the stage, in particular for us.

LIAM: It's coming along, isn't it? It is a massive place and in Thaisha and my youth, it was much wilder here. The place has been in disuse for decades. For centuries before the fall of the Shapers, this was a place where our god, our Shaper, would sometimes appear in the heavens above the city to witness his people exalting in ecstatic fervent ritual unto our keeper. And from the vantage point that we're at, you can actually see for miles, the city is surrounded by evergreen forest, and from this vantage point, and we're at the top looking down to the bottom of this amphitheater, and at the center of the amphitheater is a massive, gnarled, twisted cedar tree that is extreme-looking, but beautiful in this rugged landscape, and it's hard not to come here and not imagine this massive being lording over our city, which was the purpose of this place. But again, long out of use, forbidden for decades, and only now in the last handful of years has that begun to change, although you have heard me talking about this for many, many years. And there it is. Still more work to do. We're getting close. I know what we're going to start with. We just have to get all our magpies in a row and it's almost time.

AABRIA: This is incredible. And Thaisha is wrestling-- We've talked about it and went back and forth in letters and correspondence. It's such a fraught place that your desire to reclaim it, well-intended though it is, I think there's just that little bit of her that can't quite get comfortable standing here. You see that standing here, she had no struggles walking up, but she is going to reach towards what looks like a little dagger in her belt. It's all metal with a little horse head at the top and she'll wrap her hands around it and cast her Druidcraft into it and turn it into a horse-headed cane to walk down to view more of this with. There is something about this place that makes her want to sit in her power as a druid, as we move through a space that was so compelled and held by the god we destroyed.

LIAM: And Hal is just admiring his best friend in the world, striding down this hill into the center of this ancient place. And I think by the time they get to the bottom and they're on the edge of the performance area, you can see low wooden buildings that are-- you've never seen before off to the sides, and you can see performers and construction workers moving in and out. You can tell that they're going to be used as backstage and storage, and the tree is now high above us down at this vantage point. And as we turn to look back up from where we came, I say: Well, once we came here to celebrate a god, now we come to celebrate each other.

AABRIA: Halandil, I should never have doubted. This is amazing.

LIAM: Well, don't be too hasty because government's falling apart. I can't nail down what we're allowed to do. We've got centuries of tradition and smoke and mirrors to do everything we do, and one day we're allowed to do one thing and then three days later it sounds like it is off the table again and I'm not really sure whether to shit or go blind.

AABRIA: I know it doesn't always go well when I offer this, but you know my family has resources that you can lean into whenever you want if you need things to go a little more smoothly.

LIAM: I've gone over it with Olgud, I think we're in the black.

AABRIA: Okay, okay.

LIAM: Don't worry.

AABRIA: Thank you for showing me this. I'm going to lean over to Shadia and be like: Okay, what are those buildings?

BRENNAN: She looks over and says, "So, these are going to be-- You know, this place was a place where we had to propitiate the god of war that kept us captive and, you know."

AABRIA: Yeah.

BRENNAN: "But, that's going to be a concession stand and we're going to have--" (laughter)

BRENNAN: "We're going to have fruit leather and we're going to have-- Oh, and we're going to have the sweet, that gourd, you know that squash bread, we're going to have that."

AABRIA: Oh.

BRENNAN: "Also, if you look at this--" and you see she starts to show you these hooks what was a broad amphitheater is being separated into boxes they're putting up, so there's cool woodwork going on where the benches are still stone, but you're looking at why they're being partitioned off and you see these partitions because there are, Shadia starts to explain, "Because it's outdoors, but it's raining a lot in Dol-Makjar and you know, people used to just get wet, but you get sick, so you can pull the covers up." She does this big fabric and you see there's a waxed beautiful, and they're all multicolored and you see that some of them are harlequin pattern. Some of them are tasseled that come up and make this little rain roof. She says, "And--" You see that she takes out, she throws a crate and you see 30 little silvery filigreed, they're made of tin or something kind of cheap, but they look beautiful. There's a lot of showmanship, troubadour stuff where it's like: It's beautiful! (whispers) It's very cheap. (louder) It's beautiful! (laughter)

LIAM: As she's giving that explanation, Hal wanders away from the both of you like 50 feet away and he's standing even further at the base of the tree now, and he doesn't shout, but using Thaumaturgy, he speaks calmly and his voice carries all the way to you and beyond and says, It's everything we've been talking about for years.

AABRIA: Jesus.

BRENNAN: The work all stops and everyone turns around and you see nearby there is an ancient orcish man. He's got one of the ugliest crocheted hats you've ever seen. He's got patch-- He looks like an old quilt monster that rolled out of the bed. And he's got this ancient little orcish drum that has a triple-headed wand to play it with. He goes like, "What's everything we, what have we been talking about? Stop the work?"

LIAM: How are your knees today?

BRENNAN: "Oh, bad as can be. It's going to rain."

LIAM: Mm-hmm.

BRENNAN: "Bad, bad, bad." He says, "Is that Thaisha? Oh!"

AABRIA: Hi.

BRENNAN: "You haven't aged a day!"

AABRIA: Thank you for noticing. (laughter)

BRENNAN: You see he turns.

AABRIA: You look as youthful and vital as ever.

BRENNAN: He smiles. So Uli is 85 years old, which means that Uli remembers before the war, he's one of the few orcs who's here who remembers before the war. You see he (rhythmic thumping) hits the drum.

AABRIA: I want to slide over to him. (whispers) So what do you think about all of this? Sorry. (loudly) What do you--! How do I whisper to you? Message.

BRENNAN: Message.

AABRIA: What do you think of all of this?

BRENNAN: "The Round? Well, we outgrew The Rookery for a while. That stage is best used for students, anyhow. They need it to practice and grow and train. And then Bolaire has been kind enough to let us play at the Lyceum, at The Archanade for quite some time, but I don't know, folks from Caravan Hill and The Fray deserve a show too, I'd say. But you mean, what do I think about all this?"

AABRIA: Yeah. You remember before.

BRENNAN: "When I was a young boy, my older brother went off to join a revolution."

LIAM: I whisper to Thaisha: Settle in. (laughter)

BRENNAN: "He went off to join Odrun. You know, he was always a whippersnapper and he had a fire in him. I mean, that's the thing, you know. You lord over a people, tell them that we are meant to cover all of Aramán in conquest and victory, and he tells us to be brave, fear nothing, march forward, though the blood rings in your ears. How old dead Azgra thought he was doing anything other than training us to do what we did, I'll never know. And my brother, he came home one day and he told our mother, 'There's some wise old smiths up at the top of the city and they said they found a secret buried deep in the earth. We don't have to be afraid anymore. We don't have to, we don't have to cower, and we don't have to feel the heat of the fire behind us and the sharpness of dwarven steel in front of us. We could be free.' And my mother said, 'Who you've met are lunatics and you must ignore what they've said.' And he said, 'I think they're right. They're going to make a sword that can kill the tyrant that dwells at the center of our land.' And those were called the Lloys."

LIAM: I don't know if you've heard.

AABRIA: The city does a good job of reminding me, but it's nice to hear it.

BRENNAN: "But taking this place, the bad places were on the other side of those mountains, the top of the peaks, the blood running down into the valleys below. Here in this place, I remember when I was a boy, propitiated the Shaper. Of all the Shapers and all the peoples of Aramán, he told us to serve him, as all the Shapers did. But we were the only people that knew we were doing it without a reward. The land that was promised to us after death was the same as life, just more suffering. Endless wasteland, choked by ash and fire. But what he didn't know is that there's no way to look up from this stage at the sky and not see something more beautiful, and that's our city." You look up and see all of Dol-Makjar spreading out. "I know now that those who sang songs in this place, even if the words were meant to soothe his wrath and keep our lives in propitiating his fury, the melody, the dance, the fury and the passion, that was, that was always for us."

LIAM: I step up next to him and put a hand on his shoulder and look to Shadia and say: But in the past they used this place, we know, this place was to grapple with who we were, and today we'll use it to figure out who we are and who we will be.

BRENNAN: (Shadia) "The bins are for umbrellas." (chuckling)

LIAM: That's right, the bins are for umbrellas.

SAM: Episode title.

AABRIA: And there's something-- (laughter)

AABRIA: And there's something in listening to that story and listening to, especially listening to Shadia, that she feels that itch under her feet and she shifts, and where she's standing, and a little pulse outward under her, the grass is a little greener and the soil is a little darker. Where she stands, the earth is improved as it remembers itself. But our home is beautiful and this gift isn't for here. So it's with a little wistful sigh that she goes back and nods about the umbrellas and asks a thousand more follow-up questions.

BRENNAN: Shadia takes your hand and says, "I'm going to show you I think a part you'll like the most."

AABRIA: Oh yeah.

BRENNAN: Takes you up to the stage past this sacred cypress tree and looks out and you see right behind the back wall, and then you see they're building a backstage area and it's built into the old stone and then expanding with wood and new construction. You see the Tintazy Wood and there's this beautiful Kahadi forest, this small little wild place on the shores of this massive lake that the waterfall of the city goes out into and she looks out and goes, "I just think it's so special that, through, I mean, you know, I've only had stories about the-- to me, I was a kid when the Falconer's Rebellion ended, let alone the Shapers' War. I know they, I know that the ancients, they had to rebuild the city after the Shapers' War, but this forest survived everything. It just makes me think about--"

AABRIA: I hug her.

BRENNAN: "I really miss you."

AABRIA: I miss you so much, and I love you so much, and it's so lovely to see the (sniffles) the person you're becoming. I'm sorry.

BRENNAN: "I hope I'm becoming someone that--" She struggles in this moment to say what's on her heart.

AABRIA: I don't press. I don't think I deserve to press. So I just rub her back and look at the trees.

LIAM: Hal is allowing himself to block out the last few weeks of uncertainty and anxiety and fear just to enjoy seeing mother and daughter together with the expanse beyond them.

BRENNAN: Give me, if you'd be so kind, an insight or persuasion-- I'll actually say, because you don't step forward, I'd ask for insight instead of persuasion as you rub her back.

AABRIA: Oh, thank you. Bless you, bless you.

BRENNAN: "(exhales)" She breathes, energy reaches into her, and she calms down. She looks up, tears streaming down her face. "I know how special you are, and you can see the person I'm becoming. I feel like I can't see her at all. I sometimes get mad at myself because I feel like I don't want you to see the person, I want you to see the becoming. I just-- I don't know, Uncle Thjazi's dead, and every time you go, I know that-- I'm really scared about Alogar."

AABRIA: Yeah, I am too. But we were shaped by a god that told us not to fear and keep moving forward. It's not fair to carry that forward. But there is subtle wisdom in it. You can't live your life afraid. And Alogar is his mother's son and made a choice to protect this world with his blade. Just as you and your father are protecting this world by protecting and creating the stories and songs of it. You make the joy that all of the wandering and all of the fighting and fear are worth. And I know that's not-- I know that's not a comfort, not really. But it's what I tell myself at night when I miss you most.

BRENNAN: She leans her head against your shoulder and goes, "You make joy. You're my mom."

AABRIA: (sniffles) I love you so much.

BRENNAN: "I love you too. I'll keep dancing and keep juggling."

AABRIA: Yeah.

BRENNAN: "It'll all be here when the world is healed."

AABRIA: Well, until then-- I want to look out at the trees and in Druidic just ask this wood to watch out for my family. I mean those that I'm connected to by blood, but also all the people connected to them, and all the people that come and watch them, and all the people that they go home to, as I try to remind myself and remind these woods that we are all connected. If there is magic in the asking, I ask that the trees offer shade and protection and oxygen and life, so that this world is good, too.

BRENNAN: (blows) The wind ripples.

LIAM: (coughs)

WHITNEY: Shh.

AABRIA: Goddamn it.

BRENNAN: The wind ripples.

LIAM: I'll have some tea.

BRENNAN: As it does so, give me a nature check. You can do so with advantage.

AABRIA: Oh, thank you. Oh no.

TRAVIS: I didn't bless that one.

AABRIA: Yeah, I know.

BRENNAN: 16. You look out. You hear the wind rustling, the flight of some nearby magpies. This forest is telling you something, something soft and that would bring you joy. On a 16, you can't hear it because you hear the song of a nightingale calling you from the city. Trundling up to The Hallowed Round, Hal, you look and see a gray carriage arriving with the symbol of The Archanade on it. Taliesin, I believe we see Bolaire arriving here at The Hallowed Round.

MARISHA: Oh shit. (laughter)

AABRIA: The "oh shit" was important to me.

BRENNAN: With a quite large carriage.

TALIESIN: The very large carriage with a, I actually, I want to check, how big is the crate that I have brought?

BRENNAN: The crate that you've brought, the shipment all fits within a single carriage.

TALIESIN: Okay.

BRENNAN: Quite packed and heavy on its wheels. There's about six crates in total.

TALIESIN: That's a lot. Okay. I hop out of the carriage, clear-eyed and bushy-tailed if I had eyes or a tail. My word, it is looking lovely and everybody is working and it is just delightful. How, why are not more people working right now? Oh, that's, are they turning that into a concession stand?

LIAM: I see you way up at the height of the amphitheater and, using Thaumaturgy again, again, I don't shout, I just say: Oh, you saved me a trip. It comes out clear as a bell to your ear in the last row.

TALIESIN: Ah! I'm on my way! I am hopping up there at full speed.

BRENNAN: As you are hopping up there, Bolaire, you descend. I actually think that you have with you, I think you have Spiro and Rosadella here, who are two of your archivists to help unload the crates. Just some, you know, we're finding some help from the museum, looking out and saying, "Master Bolaire, happy to help," as they start unloading it. Is there anything you would like to do skill-wise, that Bolaire would've wanted to know before arriving here at the--

TALIESIN: Oh, I would've tested a sample of this stuff to make sure that it is not harmless in any way. And I know what I said.

BRENNAN: Yes.

TALIESIN: Yeah.

BRENNAN: Go ahead and give me an arcana check.

TALIESIN: All right.

AABRIA: Did we get a liquor license?

TALIESIN: I'm working on it.

BRENNAN: You get--

TALIESIN: That's okay for me.

MARISHA: What do you mean?

BRENNAN: (cackles)

AABRIA: (laughs)

BRENNAN: On a 21, you know, thinking about your work today before arriving here with the delivery for Hal, you have a, you know, under, at your table with all of your fine tools and instruments, the magnifying glass, everything like that. All of this is, you would swear it all looks like Penteveral work. The actual substance of the materials inside. It is-- It has faint residue of-- It's thick with illusion, which makes sense if it's paint. But there's a little bit of a hint of conjuration under it. The paint itself is a like--

AABRIA: Don't you look confused. Oh shit.

TALIESIN: Deeply.

BRENNAN: It all looks like, looking at it, but you're like, is this a, like, what? Like, what is this? What is the spell on this? You, on a 21, you double, triple-check. There is no spell effect. There is no magical aura. So you're like: Where am I getting this residue from? Did a lot of magic happen around this? I think on that 21, you're looking at it and being like-- The answers run all the way to the very grim, which are like, this is-- It's either magic you've never seen before, or this was sitting at the back of a workshop at the Penteveral for too long and got weird. And--

TALIESIN: He wouldn't have given it to me to give to him if it were dangerous, I assume. It's just better to be safe than sorry.

BRENNAN: It doesn't strike you as dangerous. You can tell that everything about it, there's nothing coiled within this, necessarily.

TALIESIN: I trust nothing right now.

BRENNAN: You will say, you do, examining the amphoras, which are completely mundane, that actually is an easy one where you do get a potter's mark, like an artisan's mark on the bottom of the amphorae from a potter's gallery in The Fray, which is not too far from here.

TALIESIN: Well, that's nice. Okay. So worst-case scenario, there is someone to interrogate if we have to.

BRENNAN: But, yeah, Hal, you see these big amphoras of paint coming down into--

LIAM: So they're bare and for us all to see on the back of the--

BRENNAN: Yeah, the, oh, the crates are coming down, and if you choose to open them, you would see them.

LIAM: Okay.

TALIESIN: I'm giving some slight instruction before I go. Well, I was going to say to put them in the back of what is now the concession stand, but clearly that is a terrible idea. Let's just put them here for now, and we will figure out where they're going to go.

BRENNAN: Olgud, who you've worked a lot with when you were running at the Lyceum, says, "What do you have against fruit leather? We got to keep the, we have to run this place. I mean, you know?"

LIAM: We're running a business.

BRENNAN: "Hey, look at here. There's two places to get money: aristocrats and selling fruit leather. What do you want us to do?"

TALIESIN: I will not put anything that has the word leather in my mouth and swallow it. That's disgusting.

BRENNAN: "Well, you don't know how to have a good time."

LIAM: We were planning on--

TALIESIN: Plenty of people in this bloody city who would disagree with that.

LIAM: We were planning on swinging by later to find you. You've saved us the trip. What is all this?

TALIESIN: Well--

AABRIA: And why are you in this mood?

TALIESIN: Ah! It's so good to see you.

AABRIA: Hi. That sounded insincere.

TALIESIN: No, it didn't, I always sound insincere.

AABRIA: Okay, fair.

AABRIA: Hi.

TALIESIN: But no, it is lovely to see you, and this place just brings out the best in me. It's beautiful.

LIAM: I will, at this point, lift one of the lids off the crate and see, it's clearly paint when I see it?

BRENNAN: Yeah, there's a little bit of staining from the paint, and it's many different colors and the amphorae are huge. These big, double-handed ceramic jugs that you can see have essentially within them a... probably multiple gallons. Each amphorae has-- how would we say it?

LIAM: Yeah. Well, as soon as I see paint, I've been thinking of Thjazi's words since he said them to me. I am seeing his words come to life in front of me. So he freezes and then puts on a smile. You know what? This will be better in the back. Could we wheel it around past the concession stand?

TALIESIN: Bless, I was hoping you'd say that.

LIAM: Take it off a ways.

TALIESIN: Boys, put it back on the cart.

BRENNAN: Olgud looks and says, "Paint. I was, I hadn't put the order in yet because we're not there yet. But we're getting close. I was going to probably order it the day after."

LIAM: Yeah, I meant to tell you about it. Just let me, we'll discuss.

BRENNAN: "Thjazi got this?"

TALIESIN: It's special paint. It's leather. You can eat it.

AABRIA: What?

TALIESIN: Doesn't that sound delightful?

AABRIA: Hey, amazing. Why don't we just--

BRENNAN: "I don't know how hard you think a museum goes, but I'll tell you what, buddy, I'm from Caravan Hill, and I've seen a thing or two."

TALIESIN: That was supposed to be a gift shop, not a concession stand.

BRENNAN: "Gift shop, museum-ass."

TALIESIN: (huffs) (laughter)

LIAM: Shadia, we're moving, come on. Don't eat the paint. Walk along.

TALIESIN: You really don't. (laughter)

BRENNAN: You head down with Bolaire to a backstage area, where you see, looking around, Hal, there is a lot of, honestly, decorative work that has to happen.

LIAM: Yeah.

BRENNAN: Primarily because for better or for worse, and probably honestly for better in a lot of ways, there was a lot of stuff here that during the Shapers' War had to be defaced. There were holy symbols to Azgra that were easy for him to cast spells through. There were a lot of things that had to happen to come in and shatter a version of his holy symbol that was casting Bane on everybody within a hundred yards. But within that, so in other words, there's a lot of work that you have to do to make this place inviting and show ready.

LIAM: Right, because it was vandalized to shit in the decade or two after the gods fell. While we're walking, before you say that, I hip bump your hip and just smile.

AABRIA: Do you want any help with Bolaire's paint? With just enough emphasis that you mentioned that very quickly when talking about all the things that Thjazi said to you in those last moments. And she remembers.

LIAM: Yes, I do.

AABRIA: Okay. She's by your side.

LIAM: Okay.

AABRIA: Absolutely. Like, you're taking point and your baby mama, just back up right now.

LIAM: All right, so I'm looking--

AABRIA: I'll kill him for you.

LIAM: I'm making sure that we've moved this cart, and I gather Bolaire's assistants are along for the ride. But we are moving away from the company, off beyond the concession stand and several barrels of fruit leather so we can talk in private.

TALIESIN: Yeah, my archivists, my two archivists who work for me, so.

LIAM: Where to start. First, thank you for coming yesterday. It was good to have a friendly face on my side. It felt like half the people in that room wanted to put a knife in my brother's back, and it was just good to have friends.

TALIESIN: It was somehow even more insane than I thought it would be.

LIAM: That said, in his final moments, my brother very feverishly told me that you had paint for me. You have paint for me.

TALIESIN: It, (sighs) it was waiting for me when I got to the museum.

LIAM: Waiting for you?

TALIESIN: I am as shocked as anyone. I am usually aware of everything that comes in or out of your wing.

AABRIA: Mm-hmm.

TALIESIN: This (sighs)-- This just appeared.

LIAM: Is the lid of one of these things easy enough to pop off?

TALIESIN: I've checked it, it's safe.

AABRIA: For?

LIAM: What is it for?

TRAVIS: (choking)

TALIESIN: I don't know. Anything that comes to the museum should be checked to make sure it's safe.

AABRIA: Okay.

TALIESIN: It wouldn't be there if it wasn't unusual. And it is unusual. There is a letter, if I recall.

BRENNAN: From, oh, there is a note from Hal that said like, With love.

LIAM: You've given it a once and a twice and a thrice over?

TALIESIN: Five times at this point. I hand the note. This is highly unusual.

BRENNAN: Give me, Tal, I'll ask for persuasion or deception. Give me an insight, Hal and Thaisha.

LIAM: Oh.

AABRIA: I'll give Guidance for you.

TALIESIN: What question in particular?

LIAM: Absolute dog shit. That's not going to help.

BRENNAN: The earlier statement as well. Just as a general vibe from Bolaire talking about how unusual all this is.

TALIESIN: The circumstances by which it showed up are definitely unusual.

BRENNAN: Sure.

TALIESIN: That's what I will say. I get to, so.

LIAM: Oh, Guidance. Okay.

AABRIA: I bet you do better than I did.

MARISHA: We're going to have to sage the set.

LIAM: Might not, might not.

TALIESIN: Yeah. No, I feel it.

AABRIA: I'm in hell.

TALIESIN: It's all the same. So I'll say 19.

BRENNAN: 19.

LIAM: I rolled a two, so with the modifier and the bump from Guidance, it's a nine.

TALIESIN: Agree.

BRENNAN: Your lovely friend Bolaire seems as perplexed, and I think there's a question hanging in the air about Thjazi telling you in his last moments that Bolaire had something for you. It's unusual. You didn't, I don't know, what would-- Does Hal know that Bolaire and Thjazi--?

TALIESIN: As far as he knows, we've met once at your house.

BRENNAN: So I think that on a nine, you don't see any, nothing. Bolaire's not acting strange at all, but there's a question hanging in the air of like, why did Thjazi?

LIAM: Yeah, it doesn't make any sense. I'm just nonplussed and just staring at the paint. I'm not sure what to make of it because it is clear that you didn't expect it.

TALIESIN: No. Not even a little.

LIAM: So what was my brother doing?

AABRIA: What do I get for my natural one?

BRENNAN: I think you--

MARISHA: Yay.

AABRIA: Yay. (laughter)

TALIESIN: You look wonderful, by the way. Let me just say, you're looking so good. Radiant, even.

BRENNAN: Bolaire, I will ask you at this moment, too, as you open the paint, looking at Hal. Who's looking a little bit perplexed, I'd like you to give me a perception check.

TALIESIN: Oh boy.

BRENNAN: I'd also like you to give me a constitution saving throw.

TALIESIN: Yay! Perception check, I'll start there.

LIAM: Did you taste the paint? Is there lead in it?

TALIESIN: I have absolutely tasted the paint. Perception check is 14.

BRENNAN: 14. Mm-hm.

TALIESIN: Constitution saving throw is 13.

BRENNAN: Looking around on a 14, I think you are looking out at this place where a god would demand tribute. On that perception check, I think you feel the nascent magic in this place of something bubbling, something boiling. There's something under this city that's running hot. On a 13 constitution save, the feeling of that magical energy, I think, you feel something turn and slither in a way that makes you feel ill at ease.

TALIESIN: Have I noticed this since-- Specifically in this place? Do I feel that it is connected to this place?

BRENNAN: I think that you don't feel that the discomfort is due to this place. Actually, maybe the awareness of the discomfort is being caused by this place. In other words, some clarity has been added in this moment.

TALIESIN: Excuse me, I--

AABRIA: Are you okay?

TALIESIN: Just a bit unsettled.

AABRIA: Do you want some fruit leather? It will soothe your stomach.

TALIESIN: (chuckles) No. Wine, but--

AABRIA: It's morning.

TALIESIN: Oh, it's morning somewhere.

AABRIA: Here, now.

BRENNAN: Using the theater cantrip, using the Thaumaturgy cantrip, you see that someone from the stage called. You see Olgud gets someone to do it for him and he says, "We have wine, we sell it by the box."

AABRIA: (laughs)

BRENNAN: "It's for parties."

LIAM: You like boxed wine?

AABRIA: Ooh!

MARISHA: Yeah.

TALIESIN: I think you very well know the answer to that. (laughter)

BRENNAN: With that, we move from this scene to Caravan Hill--

TALIESIN: Savage.

BRENNAN: -- where a dwarven woman is marching down the street and turns a corner to see a group of Arcane Marshals walking down the road. Azune.

LUIS: Yes?

BRENNAN: As you've been marching--

MARISHA: Azune!

BRENNAN: -- give me a perception with advantage.

LUIS: Okay. Ooh-hoo.

TRAVIS: Set the tone.

LUIS: Oh lord.

MARISHA: Make it better. Make it good.

LUIS: Okay, well--

MARISHA: Make it good?

LUIS: It's not great.

TRAVIS: Don't say it.

LIAM: "Make it good?"

MARISHA: That's the name of this episode, is "That's Not Great." (laughter)

LUIS: 13.

MARISHA: Jeez Louise.

LUIS: 13.

BRENNAN: 13. On a 13, you've been patrolling the neighborhood. Nothing, anything untoward. No one sent up a big arcane flare. Nothing wild has happened that you've been, you're aware of the perimeter you're keeping, and I think because you're actually successful in keeping a wider perimeter, you don't even hear glass shattering as an elven paladin leaps through a window.

LUIS: Okay.

BRENNAN: However, looking around you do see a dwarven wizard turn the corner, and Murray, you look up and see Azune in front of you.

LUIS: What are you doing here?

MARISHA: Where have you been?

LUIS: Wait, I've been working.

MARISHA: I didn't see you last night. Why didn't I see you at the funeral? Where have you been?

LUIS: I was there. Where were you?

MARISHA: I got there late.

LUIS: Well, I got there on time.

MARISHA: Well-- (laughter) Well, I'm sorry.

LUIS: Look, we need to talk.

MARISHA: There were so many damn carriages from so many damn nobles crowding the streets.

LUIS: Yes, yes, there was a lot of people there, but look, it's wild running into you like this. And my attention--

MARISHA: What do you mean? It's not that wild. I work here.

LUIS: Why are you offended?

MARISHA: Because, I need you.

LUIS: Okay, give me a second.

MARISHA: Shit is crazy.

LUIS: We need to find somewhere to talk.

MARISHA: Okay, all right, all right, all right.

LUIS: Give me a second. My focus right now is so split because I'm running in my mind, I do still have pieces of Thjazi, just flashes of the last look on his face and his body, but I also have now this lord knight that came to speak to me at the Brethren Hall, and the look behind his eyes and that intent in his voice and that hunger, Also, glad to hear that I'm not picking up on any arcane signatures. Leaving this place as a part of my patrol, and knowing that at least those of the Caravan Hill are covered, if there's any magic happening there, then there's no one that's going to report it, but I find that as I'm getting caught up in this, I need something else that's also part of my routine.

BRENNAN: Yeah.

LUIS: When I patrol the city, one of the things that I'm also looking for is I'm looking for moments between the people that live here in this city that's become my home.

BRENNAN: Yeah.

LUIS: The first home I've ever had. Those moments that are hiding in plain sight that pass between people, a moment of kindness, a whisper, a laugh, a joke shared, a soft touch, because that is one thing embedded in my routine, in my patrol, of everything that I'm looking for that matters to me more than any arcane signature that pops up. Whether I saw it or not, or whether I was blind to it, I find that I'm now in the presence of one of the few people in this place that I call my friend, and I reach out for your hand and I grab it.

MARISHA: What?

LUIS: Just come with me.

MARISHA: What? All right.

LUIS: Shh!

MARISHA: All right.

LUIS: Where can we go? I just pull you. (laughter)

BRENNAN: You pull Murray into an alley. You see the Enquirer Horace goes, "Got it, boss," and stays on the corner, is like, "Move along." There's one guy 80 feet away who's like, "Me?" Keeps walking.

MARISHA: Do you think that you're about to get lucky? Is that what that was?

LUIS: Yes, that's exactly it.

MARISHA: (snickers)

BRENNAN: (laughs)

LUIS: Now you're flustered. Why?

MARISHA: (huffs)

LUIS: (laughs)

TRAVIS: Murray's horny, y'all.

MARISHA: Mm (I don't know).

LUIS: Okay, let's hope we are lucky, actually. Well, why are you looking for me? Why are you flustered? What news do you have?

MARISHA: This whole godsdamn town has gone cat lady crazy. Ever since everything-- What happened at the execution? I thought you said you were going to try and do something.

LUIS: I was, but wait, look, I'll catch you up on that when we-- Then I start to, I'll move further away from the Arcane Marshals.

MARISHA: I feel so out of the loop.

LUIS: A portion of this conversation is, actually, the rest of this conversation is going to be--

MARISHA: Nobody tells me anything.

BRENNAN: In Message cantrip.

LUIS: Message. Yes. Yes, we had a plan, it went south. We found out--

MARISHA: Yeah, no shit.

LUIS: Yes. Yes, and we have, there are people that are on it, that are searching for the people that may have caused it to fall apart. But that's something that, look, that's not as important right now, really. Because there's nothing you and I can do about that right now.

MARISHA: Yeah, he's dead.

LUIS: Yes, he is. You noticed that.

MARISHA: Yeah.

LUIS: Look, the noble houses are closing in on us.

MARISHA: Uh-huh.

LUIS: And I know that they're closing on the Penteveral as well. They are going be closing--

MARISHA: What do you know?

LUIS: I just had a meeting with a Lord Knight Einfasen. He is one of the houses here and they're going to be choking us, and Penteveral, I'm assuming, is under fire as well.

MARISHA: Yeah, guess who just walked into my office. Actually, technically, it wasn't my office. It was Dean Tallbarrel's, but he walked in. It was Primus, Lord Primus Tachonis.

LUIS: Okay.

MARISHA: He's overthrowing Tallbarrel. I think he wants to overthrow me as well, I think, and I don't know who to trust anymore. I think Tallbarrel is in his pocket.

LUIS: Yeah, they're trying to find the people that they can control that are in the positions that they want to have the most influence in. For now, the Arcane Marshals appear to be safe. We do things that they haven't quite figured out how to do themselves. The next thing is that they're going to install people that are going to be their puppets so that they can be in complete control, which I'm sure is what they're doing at the Penteveral.

MARISHA: You have to find that deeply disconcerting, right?

LUIS: Of course I do. Of course I do.

MARISHA: I mean, the moment that any of us are no longer useful, we will see the bottom of their boot just like everybody else.

LUIS: I will never not be useful. Never.

MARISHA: You say that now. Don't you understand? Azune, this is all connected. They're trying to get more people into my school to train your replacement. You get that, right?

LUIS: I do. Of course I get that.

MARISHA: So what do you mean you think you won't one day be useful?

LUIS: Because I will find a way to always be useful.

MARISHA: But then you are falling into their scheme. You know the anecdote, right? About the frogs and the pot and boiling water. Do I have to explain this?

LUIS: I think you do. (laughter)

MARISHA: All right. You know, you have a pot of boiling water, throw a frog in, frog's going to jump out, right? Because the frog's like, "Oh, it's hot, it's boiling water."

LUIS: It doesn't die right away?

MARISHA: Well, don't get focused on the details here, but if you-- It's a story. If you put a frog in a cold pot of water and you turn the heat on and it slowly heats up over time, frog won't jump out, right? Because frogs, their physiology, they're like, they're coldblooded, right? So they're going to heat up over time. Now I'm getting caught in the details. Look, the point is the frog, we are those frogs in that pot right now.

LUIS: Right.

MARISHA: They're turning that heat up.

LUIS: Right.

MARISHA: It's slowly going to get hot, and the next thing you know, we're going to die because we're going to be boiled to death.

LUIS: Yeah. I get it.

MARISHA: Do you get it?

LUIS: I do. I get it now.

MARISHA: I don't think, you're looking at me like you don't get it.

LUIS: I just was wondering if the story was done.

MARISHA: No, yeah, it's-- What I'm trying to say is--

LUIS: You know what we need to do, is we need to find--

MARISHA: Frogs. Shit, no, now you confusing me. What do we need to find?

LUIS: Well, I was on my way to go to, well, I was going to end up at Bolaire's.

MARISHA: Yeah, I was with him all night. I haven't slept.

LUIS: You need to do something about that.

MARISHA: Yeah, I think wine. Wine would be good.

LUIS: It'll make you sleepier, wouldn't it? You need some coffee or something.

MARISHA: You don't know me.

LUIS: Okay.

BRENNAN: Murray--

MARISHA: Oh, for Occtis. Yes?

BRENNAN: I'm going to need-- (laughter)

MARISHA: I'm not directing this energy towards you.

BRENNAN: I'm not in this, okay? I'm a different guy.

TRAVIS: I cast Xanax.

BRENNAN: I'm on the other side of the fourth wall.

AABRIA: At 9th-level.

TALIESIN: At what level?

MARISHA: Yeah, I was going to say--

TALIESIN: Eyy!

AABRIA: Woo!

BRENNAN: Go ahead and give me a constitution saving throw. Difficulty 15.

MARISHA: God, why?

LUIS: Why? Out of nowhere. Oh, I know why.

AABRIA: I love when wizards don't sleep.

MARISHA: Because I'm tired.

AABRIA: You're fine.

TALIESIN: No.

MARISHA: Constitution saving throw.

LUIS: I got nervous for myself, but I slept.

LIAM: Now, you're the frog.

MARISHA: Oh. Ew.

TRAVIS: No, you are the frog.

MARISHA: Nope.

BRENNAN: Nope.

TALIESIN: No.

BRENNAN: You take a level of exhaustion.

MARISHA: Okay.

SAM: Oh wow.

BRENNAN: You have to go to sleep. But yeah, as you're saying Occtis, you feel the acknowledgement of your tiredness wash over you.

LUIS: Occtis. If I start to see you sway, I will like go to help stabilize you.

MARISHA: Look. All right, there we go, is it going to? Okay.

LUIS: It's clear we're not really getting anywhere, just the two of us.

MARISHA: They're after Occtis. Primus came in to the office looking for Occtis.

LUIS: I know where Occtis is. Do you want to find him with me?

MARISHA: Yeah, we should find him before they do.

LUIS: Then let's go. I will start to take Murray towards Caravan-- I mean, we're already in Caravan Hill, but I'm going to take her towards the tavern that I'm assuming they're--

MARISHA: Murray loosens her corset a little bit. I need more oxygen in my bloodstream, let's go.

BRENNAN: You guys get, as you're adjusting yourself, you get to the front and you see that Horace says, "Time to roll out."

LUIS: You're in charge now, Horace. I'm going to begin the other part of my job. I've got a couple of maintenance issues that I need to take care of with the Penteveral. As you can see, I'm working with someone from that.

BRENNAN: You look at this guy who's looking at you. You guys stormed off into an alley and then silently stared into each other's eyes for about five and a half minutes. (laughter) This guy's like, "I don't know what freaky shit this is." He goes--

AABRIA: Loosens her corset.

MARISHA: Yeah, I'm adjusting my corset. I dab a little bit of sweat off my bosom. It's just there always, though. It's summer.

BRENNAN: Horace looks at you and goes, "I also-- It's interesting when you can't touch." (laughter)

LUIS: Totally over my head. I don't pick up on that.

TALIESIN: Oh boy.

AABRIA: He's also my son now. (laughter)

BRENNAN: You guys head off into Caravan Hill.

LUIS: Yeah.

BRENNAN: We move from there to the Mercanaud Couturier.

AABRIA: Oh yeah.

TRAVIS: Ooh, Dior, baby.

BRENNAN: Let's go. Teor, with a wonderful, with a wonderful, a bunch of coin at your side, you walk into the marketplace, you enter this beautiful couturier, well-appointed, delightful. You see an older man who's similar to Bolaire's hair, he has a beautiful platinum rolling curls of a wig, a ruff around the neck. Turns to you and says, "Sir, welcome to Mercanaud Couturier. How may I be of service to you?"

TRAVIS: It is my first time being here, but I've been sent to acquire a bit more fashion from the Candescent Creed.

BRENNAN: "You've been sent by the Creed. Perhaps our most notable client. Well, we are delighted to be able to serve you."

TRAVIS: Wonderful. What time of day is it?

BRENNAN: It's late afternoon, I think at this point.

TRAVIS: This is establishment above my means, typically. I am quite parched from my journey. Do you have anything that I could have to drink before we begin?

BRENNAN: "I can search for something." You see, he goes over, he says, "I'm afraid we don't have anything by means of water, but we do have some sherry and brandy, if you'd like."

TRAVIS: Lead the way.

SAM: It's in a box.

BRENNAN: You walk into the back-- (laughter)

BRENNAN: -- fitting room and you see that there's another, walking into another area, you see that he has what looks to be a twin brother who is wearing a golden, shimmering long wig, a ruff as well. You see, he looks over and says, "My brother Calastro Mercanaud," and you see that the brother says, "Charmed. Some sherry for the guest," and pours beautiful gem-cut glass and hands it over to you.

TRAVIS: That's amazing. Twins are rare. Walking in this place, can I do a perception check for anything else that might be standing out? I would also like to use, I think it lets me detect fey, fiend, or undead in a 60-foot area.

BRENNAN: Incredible. Go ahead and give me a perception check.

TRAVIS: Perception check.

AABRIA: Divine Sense?

TRAVIS: Divine Sense, thank you. I was looking for it.

AABRIA: Can you Divine Sense this fucking non-Hollister music behind you right now?

MARISHA: (laughs)

TRAVIS: Perception check.

BRENNAN: This is what they're playing at Abercrombie & Fitch.

AABRIA: Yeah. (laughter)

TRAVIS: The nostrils are burned out already.

BRENNAN: 17. Got it. you look around. This place is very visually confusing. There are many different clothing racks, there's lots of bolts of fabric, the rugs are very thick. There's incense hanging in the air. Your nostrils are filled with incense, but there's also brandy. The fruit is a little bit old. There's a rich fruit smell nearby, and there's also some chimes ringing in a corner. It's a sensory overload being in this place. As you go to cast Divine Sense, they don't register as anything-- They're not celestials or fey or fiends. That incense, there's something about that incense that feels-- The smoke, you smelled that. When did you smell that? A nine-pointed star burned onto a battlefield. "Sherry?"

TRAVIS: Yes. Anything for you?

BRENNAN: "For me? No, of course, not at all. This is for our guests and clientele."

TRAVIS: Such a signature aroma. What do you call this?

BRENNAN: "The incense?"

TRAVIS: Yes.

BRENNAN: "Well, this is none other than sapphire orchid. It's a beautiful scent."

TRAVIS: It is. I'll put the drink down. I have to admit that this is unusual for me. What could someone of my station expect to get from this establishment?

BRENNAN: "Your station? I'm afraid I don't have as much information as you perhaps presume. Have you been sent here by the Creed?"

TRAVIS: Am I feeling weird, smelling this scent? Physically?

BRENNAN: Physically, yeah.

MARISHA: Oh no.

TALIESIN: Ah.

TRAVIS: Are there any windows in the room?

BRENNAN: There's some out in the other front room. Where is the money on your person right now?

TRAVIS: Typically I would tie it, a leather strap from the belt.

BRENNAN: From the belt.

TRAVIS: Just loop it around real quick.

BRENNAN: So it's just on there. I'm going to say it's a difficulty 10 to observe that that satchel is on your belt. They're each going to add a plus six to their perception rolls to notice that satchel. These need to each be a three or under.

LUIS: Oh-oh.

BRENNAN: 14. You see that Calastro's brother, whose name you did not get, looks and says, "Oh! The Creed has sent you here to be outfitted," gesturing to the satchel on your belt.

TRAVIS: Yes, by the Photarch herself with Sir Filoneus' blessing.

BRENNAN: "Wow. For the Photarch, only the finest work is reserved. Lovely to see every time we can find white velvet." Drool begins to emerge from his mouth. I'm going to need you to make two wisdom saving throws with disadvantage. (clamoring)

AABRIA: Let's go, Mufasa.

LUIS: Why even bother?

MARISHA: Yeah.

AABRIA: This is like every time I've been in Abercrombie & Fitch.

TALIESIN: You're rolling a one anyway.

AABRIA: This is normal.

TALIESIN: The drooling?

AABRIA: Yeah.

TALIESIN: (drooling grunt)

TRAVIS: Oof, a six.

AABRIA: What? No.

TRAVIS: At disadvantage, yeah.

BRENNAN: A six.

SAM: Wait, it wasn't at disadvantage. It was just two separate rolls.

BRENNAN: No, no, it's two separate rolls each with disadvantage.

TRAVIS: Oh.

SAM: Oh Jesus. (laughs)

AABRIA: It's okay.

TRAVIS: A six, and that's two natural ones.

LIAM: Oh shit!

WHITNEY: Oh fuck.

SAM and WHITNEY: (laugh)

TALIESIN: What?

AABRIA: Hey, what's up with this fucking table?

TALIESIN: What?

LUIS: Yeah, what's happening?

AABRIA: It's bad here. I want to go home.

MARISHA: We'll get sage. We'll get sage.

LIAM: How's your backup character? Is he a dog man?

AABRIA: There's not enough. (laughter)

BRENNAN: I love it.

TALIESIN: We need a young DM and an old DM. A young DM and an old DM. (laughter)

TALIESIN: God. Thank you.

AABRIA: Yeah.

BRENNAN: I gotcha. I gotcha, baby.

TRAVIS: Your mother is in here with us. (laughter)

BRENNAN: You see--

AABRIA: It's not great.

BRENNAN: -- in this moment that you are hit with two Hold Person spells at the same time.

LUIS: Oh my goodness.

BRENNAN: One of which you fail critically. As your body seizes and the Divine Sense still lingering, powerful, fiendish magic surrounds you. You even hear one of them go, "(speaks Demonic)"--

TRAVIS: Oh shit.

BRENNAN: -- as it reaches out. As you go paralyzed, you see that one of them with the white hair goes, "(sighs) Exemplary. My shears, brother."

WHITNEY: Oh!

AABRIA: Oh my god.

BRENNAN: And we're going to leave the scene.

TRAVIS: (laughs)

TALIESIN: Oh!

AABRIA: You're about to get Aslan-ed?! Oh no!

TRAVIS: I'm about to get "Silence of the Lamb"-ed. (laughter)

BRENNAN: We're going to do that.

LIAM: (laughs)

AABRIA: (laughs) Holy shit!

TALIESIN: That haircut is terrible. (laughter)

LUIS: You're just going to give it a little trim. (laughter)

AABRIA: Oh buddy!

BRENNAN: Some hours later, walking into the Mercanaud Couturier is none other than Wicander Halovar--

SAM: Oh!

BRENNAN: -- and Tyranny. The carriage pulls up, it is night as you arrive. You walk up, the market is closed down. It was late at night that you got down there. The market is closed by now, but you see that there's a small candle lit within the shop of the Mercanaud Couturier.

WHITNEY: Quick sidebar.

SAM: Yes?

WHITNEY: Okay, so no violence, right? This is going to be on you to talk your way through this. They have to listen to you.

SAM: Violence is-- I would never resort to such horrible--

WHITNEY: Absolutely agree.

SAM: No. No.

WHITNEY: But in this case--

LIAM & TALIESIN: (snickering)

WHITNEY: -- remember that everyone is connected to your family. They all know what's going on, but they still have to listen to you.

SAM: Of course they have to listen to me. I'm the Scion of House Halovar.

WHITNEY: Yeah.

SAM: I'll walk in there, demand to know what has befallen our friend Teor, and they'll tell me.

WHITNEY: Yeah, and maybe you have explicit orders to deal with him yourself, or--

SAM: Tyranny, I'm very grateful for you looking out for me, but my name carries great weight in this town. I'll be fine.

WHITNEY: All right, angel boy. Let's go.

SAM: I will simply ask them what they know, they'll tell me, and we'll be on our way. It's fine. Go in ahead of me and announce me, please. (laughter)

LUIS: Oh god. (laughter)

MARISHA: You guys are playing Scrabble and we're playing D&D. (laughter)

AABRIA: Yeah. Yeah.

BRENNAN: I want you to know--

WHITNEY: Uno reverse!

BRENNAN: -- your character's fate is no longer in my hands, right? (laughter)

BRENNAN: It's in Sam's-- Sam and Whitney. (lingering laughter)

BRENNAN: You walk up--

WHITNEY: (knocks)

TRAVIS: There's no door.

WHITNEY: There's no door? (laughter)

WHITNEY: On my head.

BRENNAN: It's all beaded curtains here at the Mercanaud Couturier.

WHITNEY: This is sexy. (laughter)

SAM: Aramán has no doors.

BRENNAN: Aramán has no doors. You knock on the door. There's a long pause and you see that walking forward is someone I think you have maybe run into before doing errands in the city. This is Rulius.

WHITNEY: Rulius.

SAM: One of the twins.

BRENNAN: Rulius Mercanaud, one of the twins. He walks up. As he opens the door, he looks at you. Go ahead and give me, even just being here, persuasion with advantage.

WHITNEY: All right, let's fucking go! Oh okay. (laughs) Six and an 11, plus-- So 11 plus seven, 18.

BRENNAN: Cool. 18.

WHITNEY: Yeah.

BRENNAN: He opens the door. He goes, "Aspirant Tyranny."

WHITNEY: Rulius.

BRENNAN: "A pleasure to see you. You look, well, radiant."

WHITNEY: Ever bright. ever right.

BRENNAN: "May the Beam reach you."

WHITNEY: I have a bit of urgency for you, my dear. The House of Halovar has sent Scion Wick. I believe you have a guest.

BRENNAN: "Ah, yes. He won't be ready until tomorrow morning."

WHITNEY: No, no. No need. He's here imminently. In fact, I'm here to announce him. He requires counsel with Teor before he gets outfitted.

BRENNAN: "Teor? The guest's name is Teor?"

WHITNEY: The guest's name is Teor, and--

TALIESIN and AABRIA: (snicker)

BRENNAN: "Ah, well."

TRAVIS: Fuck.

BRENNAN: "You've come in the nick of time."

WHITNEY: Good, good.

SAM: I will bound in after. (laughter)

BRENNAN: You walk in. You see--

SAM: The Light is all. Hello.

BRENNAN: Deep bow. "My lord Halovar."

SAM: Oh please. Your Radiance is fine.

BRENNAN: "Your Radiance, you honor us with your presence. We are absolutely delighted to have you."

SAM: As am I. Wow, what a fine arrangement of fabrics. Delightful. Is that satin over there or silk?

BRENNAN: "Eziri satin, the finest.

SAM: I knew it. I knew it.

WHITNEY: Mm-hmm.

SAM: Hi, how are you? Has business been good? Is everything all right?

BRENNAN: "Business is booming. Busy, busy, busy."

SAM: That's wonderful. I don't know if my Aspirant told you, but we're looking for a friend of mine. A taller gentleman, hairy, rugged. Quite handsome.

WHITNEY: Handsome.

SAM: I was told handsome.

TRAVIS: (gagged yelps) (laughter)

BRENNAN: "A friend of yours? Your uncle sent him our way."

SAM: I'm sure he did, yes, and we're here to retrieve him. Fetch him back. Has he arrived yet? Is he around? I'm going to do a quick scan, see if I can see anything.

BRENNAN: Give me a perception check.

SAM: Okay.

AABRIA: Oh my god.

SAM: ♪ (thoughtful hum) ♪

TALIESIN: One.

SAM: ♪ (thoughtful hum) ♪

TALIESIN: Three?

SAM: Nine. (laughter)

BRENNAN: This place is gorgeous. (laughter)

BRENNAN: It is fucking beautiful in here.

SAM: Is that a super long vest?

BRENNAN: "Velour, yes."

SAM: Wow!

BRENNAN: "The vestal gown. Would you to see?"

SAM: I would-- You know what, we're here on business, but could you just keep that aside?

BRENNAN: "Oh."

LIAM: The mercier.

BRENNAN: "We shall put it in the back room with your name on it."

SAM: Thank you.

BRENNAN: "It will stay there until the end of time."

SAM: (laughs) Oh wonderful. Thank you.

BRENNAN: He goes and takes it--

SAM: See, he's delightful.

WHITNEY: Uh-huh. (laughter)

BRENNAN: He looks and says, "And delighted we are to have you and the Aspirant Tyranny here as well. It is a marvel what the Light can redeem."

SAM: Yes. Yes.

WHITNEY: So true.

MARISHA: (laughs)

BRENNAN: So you see he closes the door behind you and ushers you further in. He says, "I want to be as clear as I can. The guest will not be ready until tomorrow morning."

WHITNEY: We understand. I would like to suggest--

SAM: I don't understand. Okay.

WHITNEY: I would like to suggest-- (laughter) -- that you understand we have orders from up top to fetch our guest and deal with him ourselves.

SAM: What she said.

BRENNAN: Great. I'm going to need a deception check.

TRAVIS: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

BRENNAN: It's going to be opposed.

AABRIA: Please.

MARISHA: Come on, this is it. It all--

AABRIA: Go roll it somewhere else.

BRENNAN: I'm going to roll this in front of the board and I'm going to add a plus four to it. That is a 14 plus four for an 18.

WHITNEY: 15 plus seven. (excited celebration)

BRENNAN: Let's go!

TALIESIN: Yeah!

AABRIA: Woo!

LIAM: (laughs)

BRENNAN: This is an extremely shrewd-- I'm going to say, as you look into this man's eyes, you recognize when someone is breathing and talking without a soul.

WHITNEY: Mm-hmm.

BRENNAN: You look into his eyes and the emptiness you see there, you see that the light being reflected in the room from his eyes has to be recreated with illusory magic, because under normal circumstances, his eyes would not reflect the light of this world.

AABRIA: This is an Abercrombie & Fitch. (laughter)

BRENNAN: So looking into this soulless man's eyes, you know where his soul is. You've seen it yourself. He looks and says, "Ah, it appears that there's been something of an error."

WHITNEY: Errors happen.

BRENNAN: "They do. It is only for us humble servants to address them immediately. I am very glad that this could be caught in time."

WHITNEY: Me as well.

BRENNAN: He moves from here and says, "Do you wish for us to produce the guest or would you be able to give us a hand? It was quite a challenge seeing the guest to the fitting room."

WHITNEY: I understand. I believe the guest will come willingly.

BRENNAN: "You would us to produce the guest such that he may arrive of his volition?"

WHITNEY: Yes.

AABRIA: Oh my god.

SAM: What are we talking about? (laughter) (laughter continues)

BRENNAN: He says, "Calastro! Brother, we have business."

TRAVIS: Oh my god.

BRENNAN: Walking up the stairs, you see that there is a dull red glow and this powdered white, rough, silk shirt wearing guy walks up and you see that there is a light casting, a red fiery light casting behind him that vanishes as he puts his wig on. As he walks into the room, you see that he's sweating. His silk shirt is drenched. He has a pair of shears in each hand. He goes, "Brother," Rulius goes, "There's been an oopsie--"

TRAVIS: (laughs)

AABRIA: (laughs)

BRENNAN: "-- and we're done. We should go get our guest and make sure that he has returned because we are going to 86 the procedure." Calastro goes, "Really? We were so close to being ready." He says, (Rulius) "Yes. All done. Let's go get our guest." Calastro goes back downstairs. Rulius walks into a corner and you see gets a thick, woolen, red, sound dampening fabric, opens it to reveal a flail, a shield. He goes over to a small box in the corner, undoes it with a key, and takes a little white pouch of coins. Hands it to you, Tyranny.

WHITNEY: Thank you. Can I have that flail?

BRENNAN: "Oh, it is the guest's. You may do it as as you wish."

WHITNEY: Thank you.

LUIS: (laughs)

BRENNAN: He goes, "So these are his effects that were going to be discarded. And that was on its way back to Sir Filoneus. But of course, given that this has all gone higgledy-piggledy--"

WHITNEY: No, you're doing amazing.

BRENNAN: "Thank you for the compliment. I shall treasure it forever." He walks out and you see Teor. (laughter)

TRAVIS: (gags)

BRENNAN: Coming downstairs and throwing the golden wig to the side, you see scratching a head that moves from skin into crystal with a fire burning in the skull is this tailor who looks around and says, "(grunts) You're a very lucky man." You are suspended with arms over your head in manacles in the center of a massive nine-pointed pentagram in the basement of the tailor's shop. You see the shears were cutting your shadow into pieces.

LUIS: (gasps) (shocked noises)

BRENNAN: He whispers a word in Fiendish, your shadow reconstitutes, and he says, "You would've had quite a ride come sunrise." And--

TRAVIS: (wheezes)

AABRIA: What?!

BRENNAN: He scuffs the circle.

AABRIA: Run away.

BRENNAN: He scuffs the circle with his foot, undoes the manacles and says, "Off you go."

LIAM: (nervous chuckle) Did they take the ball gag out? (laughter)

TALIESIN: It's a stone, actually.

BRENNAN: You are fully, by the way, under the poisoned condition. It's disadvantage on everything. You're poisoned, but you can move.

TRAVIS: Okay. (grunts)

AABRIA: (laughs)

TRAVIS: I drop to both hands and a knee and try to-- (groans) Thank you. And start to crawl my way out of the room if I can.

SAM: ♪ Crawlin' your way ♪ (laughter)

AABRIA: Not now. (laughter)

TALIESIN: (claps)

SAM: Teor?! Teor!

BRENNAN: Teor stumbles, obviously altered by whatever this incense was.

SAM: Oh my word!

WHITNEY: Hi, big guy.

SAM: Oh, are you all right? Come here. What has happened to this man?

BRENNAN: "He had a glass of sherry."

SAM: Oh. Oh, he's had too much to drink, has he?

TRAVIS: Where's my shoe?

SAM: Please, come here, Teor. Please, please give me your hands.

TRAVIS: (pounds)

SAM: Oh! Oh!

TRAVIS: A big arm.

SAM: (grunts) (laughter)

WHITNEY: (laughs)

TRAVIS: Get me out.

SAM: Sure, certainly, certainly.

WHITNEY: May I say thank you so much for the hospitality, and we'll all just forget this happened, and we will make sure Teor feels very welcome.

SAM: I won't forget that this happened.

WHITNEY: Well, okay.

BRENNAN: "What you mean?" (laughter)

WHITNEY: No, no, no.

SAM: Not without--

WHITNEY: Mm-mm, mm-mm.

SAM: -- that vest?

BRENNAN: "Oh, you card!" He goes--

SAM: This guy.

BRENNAN: -- and tosses the vest to you and says, "We have fun!"

SAM: We do have fun. Thank you so much. Come, Teor, come. As we walk out the door, I'm going to just say: The Light is all. And pump Lesser Restoration into him. My hands will glow.

MARISHA: Nice, nice.

SAM: The tattoos on my face will glow. This should help with your drunken state.

TRAVIS: Oof. Does it help?

BRENNAN: You are no longer poisoned.

WHITNEY: Are we outside?

BRENNAN: Yes. They walk to the back of the shop or Rulius stays to see if you need anything and looks to you. But you are welcome to-- you have all of Teor's stuff. You can walk right out the door.

WHITNEY: Thank you so much. And may the Beam reach you.

BRENNAN: "And may it reach you as well."

WHITNEY: Okay. Slam the door. Thaumaturgy, eyes black.

SAM: (screams)

WHITNEY: Ground quake. What the fuck are you thinking, dude? These are your enemies now. What are you doing?

SAM: I told you, we could just go in there and talk to them like nice people--

WHITNEY: Mm-mm!

SAM: -- and they would give us Teor, and they did!

WHITNEY: Do you remember three hours ago?

SAM: Yes.

WHITNEY: When you said that your mom was going to kill this guy?

SAM: My mom was, my grandma was, but these are just friendly tailors.

TRAVIS: They were cutting my shadow into pieces.

WHITNEY: Can I make a quick--

SAM: Don't know what that means.

WHITNEY: Can I make a quick-- I know, I know that you're the big boss, okay? I know you're the boss.

SAM: Yes. Thank you.

WHITNEY: Can I make a quick suggestion?

SAM: Yes.

WHITNEY: You need to figure out really fucking fast who you can trust and who you can't. I'm going to say now that you have directly gone against your family twice, you're not going to be able to trust them very much. So that includes everyone who your family knows.

SAM: But--

WHITNEY: Hi!

TRAVIS: Hello, Tyranny. If I may make a suggestion. We should leave. Now.

SAM: Certainly. May I make a suggestion if we're all making suggestions? You shouldn't drink that much.

LUIS: No.

WHITNEY: Oh my god!

LUIS: No. (laughter)

WHITNEY: Oh my god!

TRAVIS: I--

SAM: Just pace yourself.

TRAVIS: I eat Wick.

AABRIA: Yeah, thank you.

TRAVIS: No. (laughs) (laughter)

AABRIA: Finally come back to.

TRAVIS: (chomping) (laughter)

BRENNAN: Incredible. With that, as you make that suggestion to Teor. You get up on your feet after one of the most harrowing experiences of your life. We are going to move back from this table and we need everybody else. Full swap. Everybody out and everybody in.

AABRIA: Oh, amazing.

SAM: Full swap?

TRAVIS: Full company swap.

BRENNAN: Full company swap.

LIAM: Travis, that was like a scene from "Mandy."

MARISHA: That truly was.

TALIESIN: Hey!

TALIESIN: This is the Joker Harley Quinn I've always wanted.

MARISHA: Yeah, Bruce Willis was about to ride out on a motorcycle.

LIAM: Yeah.

TALIESIN: God!

MARISHA: Zed's dead.

WHITNEY: A big-ass chainsaw.

LIAM: We're going to hear about a leather suit with a zipper for a mouth?

MARISHA: Yes. (laughter)

WHITNEY: Oh my god, I'm sweaty!

LIAM: God, that was awesome. Awesome sequence.

ROBBIE: I think we should separate.

TALIESIN: Same cup. Move down.

MARISHA: Oh god.

ROBBIE: My energy's such dogshit.

LAURA: Oh yeah, how many--

LIAM: Whoo-hoo! (chattering)

LUIS: Oh my goodness.

ROBBIE: Looks like it's made out of steel and--

MARISHA: It's okay.

LAURA: Ooh, I want to sit next to Matt.

MATT: Please do.

ROBBIE: Where are we going? Are we going three up or two up? Where are you going?

ASHLEY: Wherever.

ROBBIE: Smack dab in the middle? That's scary.

ASHLEY: Well, okay. I can also take an end.

ALEXANDER: You want an end? You'd rather have--

ASHLEY: No, I'm okay.

ROBBIE: That was broken.

LAURA: Gosh.

ALEXANDER: Oh rats. Where'd my paper go?

ROBBIE: Get handsome Sam.

ASHLEY: Get a little Sammy.

LAURA: Thank you--

ROBBIE: What happened-- Okay.

ALEXANDER: So if we do this really quick before Brennan gets back, folks, this will be fine. (laughter)

MATT: Welcome back.

BRENNAN: Full table swap. We're back, baby. Hell yes. What a hoot. (laughter)

LAURA: What a hoot.

BRENNAN: What a hoot. Some abs. Sometimes you get to get real freaky. Arriving back from Caravan Hill, it is late afternoon. Julien.

MATT: Mm-hmm.

BRENNAN: Waiting outside, upon arriving at Hal's home, you find an older orcish warrior, Inez Rountree, who is essentially just keeping watch over the home while Thjazi is in revere in memoriam. She informs you, saying, "I'm sorry, my friend, Hal and Thaisha are out on business. I think they're either headed to The Archanade or perhaps down to The Hallowed Round, but they should be back presently, I imagine."

MATT: (huffs) How presently is presently?

BRENNAN: "I do think it was just for a short time to go find-- Can I offer you some Yahrgraz, or--?"

MATT: Ugh. No, thank you. You said they were going to which places? It was the--

BRENNAN: The Hallowed Round, the Archanade. But I imagine, wending your way over here from the Palazzo Davinos, your late start to the day, you see walking up the road behind you. Does Occtis still have his disguise on?

ALEXANDER: If it's been less than an hour, yes.

BRENNAN: Yes. You see Thimble chiefly among them, but Thimble, Kattigan, Vaelus, and Occtis all returning to the home, walking up the street. For those of you here, Thimble, you see Julien Davinos--

LAURA: (scoffs)

BRENNAN: -- who you have not seen in many years.

LAURA: This pretty boy. What are you doing here?

MATT: I have business. What are you doing here?

LAURA: I guess I live here now.

MATT: Do you know where Hal is? Or Thaisha?

LAURA: No.

MATT: Then you're of no use to me. Acknowledges you as you approach. Mistress Elf, I am sorry to hear that you've lost something important to you. It seems it's been going around.

ASHLEY: Thank you.

LAURA: Hey.

MATT: What?

LAURA: I come up close. He didn't deserve it, you know. All the shit you gave him.

MATT: Just smiles and waves you off and keeps walking.

LAURA: Yeah, keep running, like you always do. You may have everybody else fooled, Sir Julien.

MATT: Stops. I would ask you kindly to reconsider your tone in the face of your betters.

LAURA: (scoffs) (softly) I know you're not my better. I see you. The flutter of my wings is very loud against your ears as I fly away.

MATT: You go to fly away and the gauntleted hand moves rapidly from underneath his cloak and goes to grab the back of your wings to hold you in place.

BRENNAN: Give me athletics versus acrobatics.

LAURA: You motherfucker. If you fucking damage my wings, you piece of– 27.

MATT: Hold on.

ASHLEY: (chuckles)

BRENNAN: The confidence.

ROBBIE: (chuckles)

MATT: Okay, technically, for me, it's a 22, but I have my Tactical Mind fighter ability to burn a Second Wind to add a d10 to that roll.

BRENNAN: (gasps) Okay.

MATT: Which I will do right now.

BRENNAN: So we're going to need a six or higher so there's a 50% chance.

MATT: That's a 10.

LAURA: (groans)

ROBBIE: Oh no!

BRENNAN: Three of you watch as a gauntleted hand clasps Thimble's wings.

ALEXANDER: Absolutely not. Let her go.

MATT: I will in a moment. However, society works in certain ways, and riffraff should learn to show some respect.

LAURA: You're a piece of shit. You always were.

MATT: At least I'm in good company. And he flicks you off.

BRENNAN: Give me perception with advantage.

MATT: It's an 11.

BRENNAN: Great. On an 11 perception, what do you look like right now?

ALEXANDER: If it has been less than an hour since the bar fight--

BRENNAN: Yeah.

ALEXANDER: -- then I still look the way I did.

BRENNAN: Yeah.

ALEXANDER: But the voice I used was Occtis'.

BRENNAN: I think even on an 11, the voice doesn't match the body. I think that Occtis was-- You were not at the funeral at the same-- No, because you were at the funeral at the same time, correct?

ALEXANDER: I believe he saw me, yeah.

BRENNAN: Yeah.

MATT: Saw him, but we didn't have much of an interaction beyond that.

BRENNAN: You heard his voice in the corner, I think.

MATT: All right. Give a keen glance off of this heated exchange. Vaelus, was it?

ASHLEY: Yes.

MATT: Have you seen the Tachonis boy from the event earlier?

ASHLEY: I can't say that I have.

MATT: Hmm. Now, if you do, it is of utmost importance that we speak. He, amongst many others, may be in immediate danger.

ASHLEY: Hmm. I will make sure to send him your way immediately.

MATT: Thank you. (sniffs) Hmm.

BRENNAN: Julien, where do you head off to?

MATT: Julien's going to turn and go heading towards the... The Archanade.

BRENNAN: As you go to head off towards The Archanade, you're walking down the street. Occtis. Julien Davinos is someone that you know. He's older than you, considerably.

ALEXANDER: Yeah.

BRENNAN: I think as he says, "Occtis is in grave danger," you see him walking off. The coldness--

ALEXANDER: Yeah.

BRENNAN: -- and casual cruelty in his demeanor makes what he's saying seem very true. These were not honeyed words by a long shot.

ALEXANDER: Yeah. Did he say I'm in danger?

LAURA: That's what I heard.

ALEXANDER: Okay, great. Good. Don't know what that's about other than the fact that my family did all of this, and I've been actively working against them. But other than that, I can't imagine why they would be mad at me.

LAURA: Do they know?

ALEXANDER: That I-- I didn't think they did, but I'm going to take that as a guess that they do.

MATT: I've rounded the corner and attempted to square around the other side unseen.

BRENNAN: Give me stealth.

ALEXANDER: I mean, I figured they might figure it out, which is why I've been kind of, you know. Then I used the wrong voice when you got grabbed and then I was--

LAURA: Well, I'm sorry about that. Look, he's nothing but a liar. He lies about everything.

MATT: (whispers) 23.

LAURA: You don't have to believe him. Maybe you're not in danger.

BRENNAN: (mouthed) You hear all of this.

ALEXANDER: I mean, why would he say that if-- I don't know. Okay, w-well, we got to find-- (inhales and exhales sharply) We have a job to do. We got to finish that first. We can deal with me later.

LAURA: Occtis, do you want to talk to him?

ALEXANDER: Who? Him? Oh gods, no. Should I?

LAURA: I'll back you up if you want to.

ALEXANDER: (sighs)

ASHLEY: I will, too.

ROBBIE: Yeah, go on. Do it. Everybody's in danger all the time. I give him a slap on the ass, pushing him toward where took off to.

ALEXANDER: Okay, weird. I'll start heading down the street.

BRENNAN: You begin to head down the street. Julien sort of vanished, but Julien, you hear Occtis heading off on his own.

MATT: I begin to walk back in the path where I took so I can head him off at the pass, hopefully unseen by the rest of this troop.

BRENNAN: You head off. As you do, Kattigan, you look and see Thimble here outside the home where Thjazi still lies. You have no idea, Thimble, and neither do you, Kattigan, where Teor is. And Vaelus, as you have for long centuries, putting one foot in front of the other, now know that the Stone of Nightsong has passed beyond the reach of the thief who took it from you.

ASHLEY: Shit. Hmm. I don't know what to do.

BRENNAN: You watch Occtis walking away and you see that little dead fox (skitters) with its button eyes walking behind him.

ASHLEY: Now that I'm getting a better look at this creature, can I walk up to it and get a closer look?

BRENNAN: Yeah, give me investigation. Investigation or religion.

ASHLEY: Okay. Oh. Okay. Great.

ALEXANDER: That was so definite.

LAURA: Ka-thunk.

ALEXANDER: 17.

BRENNAN: 21 on religion or investigation?

ASHLEY: Religion.

BRENNAN: That little thing with button eyes is unnatural. It's a spirit of undeath. You are one who but for injury or catastrophe will never die. You see that fox turns around, looks at you, cocks its head.

ASHLEY: I cock my head.

BRENNAN: It smiles, a little (sniffle), twitches its whiskers and heads off. The young Tachonis boy who walks away from you is of a family that for generations, even when the God of the Sun still lived, they were a family of Shadow. The Halovars were the Priestly Family of Flame. The Tachonis the Priestly Family of Shadow, of the journey through night to the next day. They were gifted with the rites of funeral cremation, of moving from one realm to the other and though that young man is not a sorcerer, he has wielded a strange gift to make a little dead creature that regarded you with kindness. Is it possible that dead things can still love us?

ASHLEY: Occtis.

ALEXANDER: Yeah, what? Yeah?

ASHLEY: Did you make this creature?

ALEXANDER: He looks down and goes: Pin, I told you you were supposed to stay out--

BRENNAN: (squeaking)

ALEXANDER: Yes, I made him and he has a hard time staying in the dimensional pocket that I put him in. It's something to do with the fact that he's made out of different pieces. It doesn't really-- it's coded to one part of him, but the other part couldn't get his hand out.

ROBBIE: Nerd.

ALEXANDER: I'm sorry, yes, I did make him.

ASHLEY: How did you do such a thing?

ALEXANDER: I got-- there was most of a fox and then I-- I talked to some people and I got some pieces of other foxes and I just put them back together.

ASHLEY: And brought it back to life.

ALEXANDER: Yeah, there was the part with the magic that brought him back to life. Yes, I did do that, and then it was a thing where I was supposed to be making a fearsome thing that would fight and then he didn't.

ASHLEY: Have you done it before or since?

ALEXANDER: Yeah, all the time.

ASHLEY: Insight check. (laughs)

BRENNAN: Insight versus deception. I think at this point--

ASHLEY: Oh, natural one. (laughter) Fuck!

BRENNAN: Hey, Vaelus, this kid does this all the fucking time and I think at this point, in terms of how long it takes to get from Caravan Hill, I think your Disguise Self fades, and Julien, you emerge, intersecting with Occtis. Vaelus, you've moved a little bit away from Thimble and Kattigan.

LAURA: Oh shit, wait. Occtis. I'll fly up. Vaelus, are you going with him?

ASHLEY: I will go with you.

ALEXANDER: Okay. Yeah, sure. I guess I'm talking to the guy.

LAURA: She's a total badass, she'll keep you safe.

ALEXANDER: Yeah, I saw earlier, she destroyed that man.

LAURA: I know.

LAURA: Hey, I've got to go find Teor.

ALEXANDER: Okay, yeah. That makes sense.

LAURA: It's good to see you.

ALEXANDER: It's good to see you.

LAURA: I'll talk to you again.

ALEXANDER: Yeah, yeah. I'll be okay.

ASHLEY: I will protect him.

ALEXANDER: Okay. I'll see you soon, yeah?

LAURA: Don't take any shit from Julien.

ALEXANDER: I'm absolutely going to. He's scary.

LAURA: I'll fly up, I pat your cheek.

ALEXANDER: Okay.

LAURA: All right.

ALEXANDER: I'll see you later.

ROBBIE: You've got to be super excited. It's just you and me now.

LAURA: Ugh.

BRENNAN: (laughs)

LAURA: Come on, Kattigan.

BRENNAN: As Thimble and Kattigan walk into Hal and Thaisha's home, you see Inez, herself a veteran of the Falconer's Rebellion, looks up to you. "Kat, it's good to see you again."

ROBBIE: Yeah.

BRENNAN: "You want to sit in a room with a dead friend? I've been doing it all morning." She passes out some Yahrgraz and Thimble and Kattigan walk inside. Occtis, you walked outside with Vaelus, looking at this little undead creature you've made and you are talking to someone who, again, every step is so purposeful. Everything's so graceful.

ALEXANDER: Why are you asking about him? And I put him back in the pocket dimension. He's supposed to stay in there.

ASHLEY: I just think it's beautiful and fascinating that you were able to build such a thing.

ALEXANDER: I can honestly tell you that is not the response I thought you were going to give. A lot of people don't like him and they get weird about it and I just thought--

ASHLEY: Can you bring him back out?

ALEXANDER: (poofs) He's on the shoulder. Yeah, he was supposed to be scary and then I made him and he absolutely was terrible at it and so I just bent some things and we have familiars and spellcasters and whatnot and I was like: I think I can do that and so I did that and made him that.

ASHLEY: There's so many bits and pieces to him.

ALEXANDER: Yeah, I had to work with what I had. It's easier when you have a whole thing, apparently.

ASHLEY: Like a whole body?

ALEXANDER: Yeah.

ASHLEY: Could you do it with a whole body?

MATT: Occtis Tachonis.

ALEXANDER: Shit.

MATT: You hear from behind you.

ALEXANDER: (stutters) Hello, hi, yes.

ASHLEY: I unclick my censer.

MATT: You keep strange company these days.

ALEXANDER: Look at me.

MATT: Heh. I guess it does run in the family. I've been looking for you and I do not believe I'm the only one.

ALEXANDER: That sounds terrible, why?

MATT: It seems there are a number of roiling events as of late and there are quite a few interests beginning to crumble.

ALEXANDER: Okay.

MATT: You are a name that has come up as of late, possibly tied to a dangerous crux. Your family, you have not spoken with them recently, have you?

ALEXANDER: I haven't seen my family in at least five years. I was at the Penteveral and then the last six months, I've been traveling.

MATT: So you got out?

ALEXANDER: Yeah, I just didn't say anything. I just walked out a door and (nervous chuckle).

MATT: (chuckles) Strangely, I know what that's like. Perhaps we should speak somewhere more private. I have some questions to ask, if you would be so kind as to do me the honor?

ALEXANDER: Sure, you're being weirdly nice, but sure.

ASHLEY: I will come along as well.

MATT: Certainly. I'm going to find the nearest side alley or shaded corner to have a very quick close conversation. It has come to the attention of House Davinos and House Royce above it from Aranessa, Lady Aranessa herself that a plot had been hatched to rescue Thjazi. Do you know anything of this?

ALEXANDER: No.

MATT: Do I believe him?

BRENNAN: Insight versus deception.

ALEXANDER: Hell yeah, let's go, I'm bad at this. Eh, not terrible.

MATT: That's okay, I'm really bad at this.

ALEXANDER: That would be 21.

MATT: That's a three. (laughs)

ROBBIE: (hoots) (laughs)

MATT: I'm like: It's for the best because it seems many individuals are looking for those involved. Apparently, it did not work, of course.

ALEXANDER: Yeah, he's dead.

MATT: Indeed. But from people I trust implicitly, you seem to be tethered into this.

ALEXANDER: I-- I mean, I-- My family did want him dead, and I guess that's what they got. But I did know him and he was nice to me when I was a kid.

MATT: Your family is searching for you.

ALEXANDER: Okay. Right.

MATT: The worst of your family is what I can gather.

ALEXANDER: (nervous chuckle) Right. Okay.

MATT: Is there any reason why they would be, and why this has come to the attention of my lady?

ALEXANDER: I honestly couldn't tell you. I don't know why they would want to see me. They sent me away, they didn't have any use for me.

MATT: Then would you be so kind as to speak with Lady Aranessa? We need to get you somewhere safe so they can't find you and then we can figure out what your place is in this before it ends up costing you or other lives.

ASHLEY: Keep going.

ALEXANDER: Okay, yeah. I can go talk to her.

MATT: Good, come with me.

ALEXANDER: Oh my god, okay.

BRENNAN: Julien, you take off with Occtis and Vaelus. Do you follow along?

ASHLEY: I follow along and if Pin is still out, I've picked him up at this point and I'm just petting it.

BRENNAN: I think, too, feeling Pin in Vaelus' arms, you know that even if there is some distance created, you'll have that connection.

ALEXANDER: Yeah.

BRENNAN: As you head to the Palazzo Davinos, I'm going to ask Matt, Alex, and Ashley to step out and I'm going to ask Sam, Whitney, and Travis to step in.

MATT: Sorry about that.

LAURA: You bastard. And I'm supposed to be hard to catch.

BRENNAN: (laughs)

LAURA: But it's happened twice.

ALEXANDER: Don't let this be a precedent.

BRENNAN: Let me get Liam and Aabria here as well.

MATT: You got summoned.

WHITNEY: Where do you want to go?

SAM: I think Robbie's there.

WHITNEY: Okay, want to go here?

AABRIA: Anybody here?

AABRIA: I don't know what's happening.

TRAVIS: I'm kind of--

WHITNEY: Oh, thank you.

LAURA: Should I shimmy further away?

LIAM: Threesies?

WHITNEY: Huh?

SAM: I think we're going foursies because Robbie's supposed to come.

LAURA: Robbie's four on that side, three on this side.

AABRIA: Do you want to be on the end?

BRENNAN: Hell yeah.

WHITNEY: Oh my god. (laughter)

SAM: In my Trapper Keeper.

WHITNEY: Right in my ear, too. A little ASMR treat for me.

BRENNAN: Hell yeah, ba, ba, ba.

BRENNAN: Hell yeah.

BRENNAN: Hal and Thaisha, I think you arrived back, you arrived back, da, da, da, from The Hallowed Round and a lovely day there. You depart from Bolaire and the paint is all set up and safe and the work continues and there will be people there all night watching. But sunset comes and you arrive back at the house to find Kattigan and Thimble at the house waiting and I think in the hours since then, having no idea where Teor could be. You've flown around, you've asked people. There's just no clue where-- You know that he had a meeting at the Villa Aurora but after that, he's in the wind. But I think by this time, you guys have circled back to Hal's house as Hal and Thaisha come back.

LIAM: Oh, are you taking me up on my offer to stay a while?

LAURA: Maybe, probably not, maybe. Have you seen Teor anywhere?

LIAM: No, he's hard to miss. I have not.

AABRIA: You good?

ROBBIE: Thanks for the steak. And Kattigan has pilfered a bone-in ribeye from their cellar and he's got it over his shiner that he's nursing from the bar fight but he's also eating it at the same time.

LIAM: Ugh.

ROBBIE: It's raw.

AABRIA: You're--

SAM: Gross.

ROBBIE: I'm all right, I'm feeling good. Fresh and young, yeah.

AABRIA: Is he going to die of this?

ROBBIE: No, it's just a black eye. (laughter)

BRENNAN: I think your sense for nature of him eating this raw steak is that the immune system is being so bolstered by the Yahrgraz that the alcohol--

AABRIA: If you keep it off-kilter, it doesn't know to kill you for this, got it.

BRENNAN: Arriving back, Hal, there are some people you can reach out to to see if anyone's got a bead on Teor.

AABRIA: Hold on. You left with two.

LAURA: Yeah.

AABRIA: Where's Occtis?

LAURA: That piece of shit, Sir Julien, came searching for him. He said that--

AABRIA: And you let him go?

LAURA: No, because Vaelus went with him. She is--

AABRIA: Why do you think that's better?!

LAURA: No, because she came and saved us. So listen, we went to the Crow Keepers. It went so bad.

ROBBIE: (chuckles)

LAURA: Look at his eye.

ROBBIE: Yeah.

LAURA: And Vaelus came in, crushed the place. She fucking killed people.

ROBBIE: Pretty sweet.

LAURA: We just wanted to talk. (chuckle) There's so much happening.

ROBBIE: Lots of political intriguing.

AABRIA: Every piece of metal on her is beginning to go red hot.

LAURA: I'm really sorry.

AABRIA: Is he safe?

LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

AABRIA: Are you sure?

LAURA: Yeah, of course.

ROBBIE: Maybe.

LAURA: Totally.

ROBBIE: Sorta.

LAURA: (stutters)

AABRIA: No. Leaves rustle, the trees' branches sway.

LAURA: Wait.

AABRIA: And there is a wolf in front of you now.

LAURA: Before you go crazy like you always do, Sir Julien said he needed to talk to him. He said that-- Well, this is kind of worse. He said that Occtis was a great--

AABRIA: I'm going to jump up and snap at you, not trying to hit you.

LAURA: Oh my god. I am so sick of people trying to grab me today!

AABRIA: I might be able to, everyone else has.

LIAM: Why do they want the boy?

LAURA: I don't know. They said he was in trouble. Julien said he wanted to talk to him. Julien never wants to talk to anybody. I figured it--

LIAM: And what's the Teor of it all?

LAURA: We were betrayed, right? You know that? Right?

LIAM: Yes.

AABRIA: I've taken off, I'm going to go find Occtis' scent. Fuck this shit.

LAURA: She's so--

BRENNAN: You take off, give me survival. You can do so with advantage because you are in a form that has scent.

LAURA: And she wonders why I didn't want her to come with us. Not that it would've mattered. Actually, she probably would've helped.

AABRIA: Yeah, you think? I'm a wolf.

BRENNAN: 19. You pick up a scent and take off into the city as fast as you can. Incredible. As you take off, I think, Aabria, thank you very much.

AABRIA: Yeah.

BRENNAN: We're going to clear.

AABRIA: Bye.

WHITNEY: Bye. (laughter)

TRAVIS: Wolves don't have middle fingers.

WHITNEY: My best friend.

BRENNAN: Hal, working as best as you can, there are people you can reach out to.

LIAM: I mean, I know a third of the people in this neighborhood.

BRENNAN: Yeah.

LIAM: So I can send a runner.

BRENNAN: You send a runner, just, word for Teor. Has anyone seen anything? As night falls, a runner comes back saying, "I haven't heard much but there are some people on their way here." And I would like Luis and Marisha to come out.

ROBBIE: Whoa.

LAURA: Whoa. Whoa.

BRENNAN: We're running it hot and heavy here.

ROBBIE: Yeah, bring 'em in.

BRENNAN: Ta, ta, ta.

MARISHA: I'm unprepared.

BRENNAN: Unprepared, I know. Hot-swapping, hot-swapping.

LAURA: We can scooch.

TRAVIS: When are we ever prepared?

BRENNAN: I love it.

SAM: The writers are going crazy-- (laughter)

SAM: -- with the teleprompters.

WHITNEY: Yeah, prompter's down.

TRAVIS: On auto-zoom.

BRENNAN: Going crazy, going crazy, going crazy.

LIAM: Keyboard cat is at it.

BRENNAN: A moment later, Murray and Azune.

LUIS: Yes.

BRENNAN: Visiting The Guard Tower, you found the place deserted. But a quick survey of the neighborhood, Vaelus killed two people in there.

LUIS: Oh god.

BRENNAN: She killed the guildmaster and she killed one of the journeyman thieves there. You know for a fact that the thieves' guild's not going to make a move on someone that had that much arcane potency. But they're going to go either, they know how to use the systems of actual control and authority against people. So they're going to go to whatever remains of the Revolutionary Guard or the Council and let them know that there's a dangerous elven murderer. All that it needs to be is that she's wearing garb of, or if she has any sign of being religiously-affiliated with the dead Shapers, that's all the Revolutionary Council's going to need to be like "There's a dangerous immortal walking our streets."

LUIS: Okay. We gathered that from?

BRENNAN: From canvassing.

LUIS: Got it.

BRENNAN: Talking to people in the neighborhood, the words, all they say. The Crow Keepers are in the neighborhood and they describe Vaelus to a T.

LUIS: Any sense of where they left headed to, if she's so obvious?

BRENNAN: Hal and Thaisha's.

LUIS: Great.

BRENNAN: And I think you guys arrive.

LUIS: 100%.

MARISHA: We killed Salamon, Saruman? Salamon, Salaman?

BRENNAN: Solomon.

LAURA: Solomon.

MARISHA: Sauruman. We killed Salaman?

LAURA: You killed Saruman?

MARISHA and LAURA: Sauruman? (laughter)

BRENNAN: "Too much of the Halfling's Leaf." (laughter)

ROBBIE: Finally.

MARISHA: I'm just saying, he was one of my guys.

BRENNAN: "It makes you paranoid, Gandalf." (laughter)

LUIS: I don't know who those guys are and I don't know if I want to.

MARISHA: I really liked Solomon.

BRENNAN: Azune and Murray arrive at the house, as you see that people from the neighborhood are coming and Thimble, Kattigan, Hal, you're corroborating stories. Someone says they saw him get to the Villa Aurora. Someone else says that they saw him leave. He was headed maybe back for your house but he was taking the bridge, he was taking the Mid-City Bridge from the marketplace. That's the last place you've gotten, that maybe he was in the marketplace when Azune and Murray arrive.

LIAM: Sorry, that's the bead on?

BRENNAN: Teor.

LIAM and LUIS: Teor.

BRENNAN: Yeah.

LIAM: Not Occtis, Teor. This is a lot to keep up with. I feel like my brother's death has set off a lot of dominoes falling and I can't see the board.

LUIS: I come in and what's the atmosphere in the space? Who at the table is there?

LAURA: Silence.

SAM: Not us.

LUIS: Not the two of you. Okay.

LIAM: Just us.

WHITNEY: Don't look.

LIAM: And Travis is, Teor is not here.

SAM: Blur us.

LUIS: I think I'll go to Thimble and I'll say: Well, I saw the work that was done over there.

LAURA: It was Casimir.

LUIS: It was?

LAURA: Yeah. It was Casimir. And Cyd walked in and Casimir chased him. I don't know.

LUIS: Cyd wasn't involved?

LAURA: No.

LUIS: That's a relief.

LAURA: Yeah.

LUIS: It seems like it's a very down atmosphere here. What have we missed?

LAURA: We're trying to find Teor. I want to get out of town. I want to chase him down.

LUIS: You have a lead on them?

LAURA: Yeah. They're going to some new stronghold in Gormalay. He sold everything. All of the shit Thjazi and I had, he sold it all.

LIAM: So you had a plan in place and one weak link sank the whole affair?

LAURA: Yeah. It was a small chain.

BRENNAN: You can hear noise of footsteps approaching. It's gotten to a later hour, it's been night for maybe a little more than two hours at this point. And you see Teor's frame stumble into the home. Along with the Lord Wicander Halovar and the Aspirant Tyranny.

TRAVIS: Do you have anything to drink?

LAURA: Teor.

TRAVIS: Maybe not sherry.

ROBBIE: There he is. (laughs)

WHITNEY: Hey, just looking around, does anybody here like you?

SAM: Yes, Hal does.

LIAM: Sure.

LAURA: Totally ignoring Wick.

SAM: Oh, look at that.

LAURA: I'll fly down, is Teor walking? Is he stumbling, what's happening?

TRAVIS: He's wobbling side-to-side. The poison's been removed but getting your shadow cut will fuck you up.

LAURA: I'm going to fly and I'm going to grab his two braids in front of him and steer him as I'm flying backwards and try to get him to a chair and sit down.

LIAM: I take a knee by the chair. I'm sorry, we have either Yahrgraz or I have some wine. It was in a box but--

LAURA: Don't you have water?

SAM: I have water. I brought it in a flask.

WHITNEY: Hello.

LAURA: What are you doing here?

TRAVIS: You remember Wicander and Tyranny?

SAM: I don't remember you, actually.

LAURA: No, I don't--

WHITNEY: We haven't met. Hi, you're so little. Hi, I'm Tyranny. We just rescued--

SAM: May I grab you with--?

LAURA: No, fucking what?!

SAM: I'm sorry, I don't know. I'm sorry.

WHITNEY: Okay.

SAM: I've never seen--

WHITNEY: We just brought your friend back from imminent doom.

LAURA: You didn't do this to him?

WHITNEY: No!

TRAVIS: No, it's true. I went to their house to try and follow up on how he was reacting last night.

SAM: Here, drink.

TRAVIS: I was sent-- Thank you. (chugs) That's very good water.

WHITNEY: I thought he'd lap it up. I kind of wanted him to lap it up.

LAURA: (giggles)

TRAVIS: I was sent to go collect something for the Candescent Creed. I tried to learn any information I could. I was sent to go get vestments and clothes and I was drugged and almost tortured within an inch of my life and these two, these two came and saved me.

MARISHA: You know he's with the Candescent Creed, right?

TRAVIS: Yes, I am horrifically aware of it.

WHITNEY: Not. Really.

ROBBIE: How many life debts do you owe at this point?

TRAVIS: It's a long list.

LIAM: I'm afraid to ask, but do you know if you were followed?

SAM: Oh. I didn't look, did you look?

WHITNEY: I looked.

BRENNAN: Give me a perception-- (laughter) Give me a perception check.

WHITNEY: A what?

BRENNAN: A perception check.

WHITNEY: Yes, sir. Perception? Goddamn it.

LIAM: Roll high, roll high.

WHITNEY: Seven. (laughs)

BRENNAN: Hey, Tyranny, you were not followed.

TRAVIS: This may be very well-known but the Candescent Creed is not what it appears. The people in that house, the people that work for them are some of the darkest people I've ever met.

LAURA: Then what are they doing here?

LIAM: Is what he says true?

SAM: Hal, I'm so sorry about your brother. I'm so sorry I couldn't do more and I've learned some things in the last few hours that I-- He's right.

MARISHA: I thought this was common knowledge, by the way. Are you guys all just getting up to speed on all this?

SAM: Well, it wasn't common knowledge to me.

MARISHA: (laughs)

SAM: Oh yes.

ROBBIE: (laughs)

MARISHA: What's your name?

LAURA: No, wait. What? No.

MARISHA: I haven't met him. Keep going. Put a pin in that.

SAM: I have recently learned that my entire life's a lie and everything I've believed since childhood has been a string of delusions and manipulations to-- (sighs) I'm having a very bad day.

MARISHA: (mock weeps)

WHITNEY: Okay, so yeah, that's why we'd--

SAM: Don't be rude.

WHITNEY: Hey, I'm going to ask for a little compassion here. This guy, this nobleman really risked his own hide to save you. I do not know why his family is trying to kill you but that has put us on a list of persona non grata to his very powerful and very scary family and also my very scary demon family. So I would love to hear why you think they want to kill you.

TRAVIS: Well, I came looking for information for my brother, Cyd.

LAURA: We have that.

TRAVIS: You do?

LAURA: Yeah. Casimir betrayed everybody. He's the one that broke into the hideout.

TRAVIS: Casimir?

LUIS: Yeah.

LAURA: Cyd chased him down. Cyd wanted to know why he didn't show up and he stole a deed. He stole a deed to a stronghold and Casimir chased him out. I think Cyd is on the run from him.

TRAVIS: My brother stole the deed and is being chased by Casimir?

LAURA: Yeah, and all of his crew, I guess. We have to chase him down.

ROBBIE: Yeah, objectively, she's got a tiny brain, but she's super smart.

LAURA: It's really big for my size.

ROBBIE: Yeah.

MARISHA: Yeah, it feels proportional.

TRAVIS: It cannot be overstated that these two risked their lives for me. So wherever we go next, they are not safe here in Dol-Makjar any longer.

SAM: I have been told several times in the last few hours that I'm in very, very bad danger and I'm starting to believe that to be true.

LUIS: What has changed?

SAM: Well, I guess if you anger my family, they try to kill you and I think I'm probably angering them a bit.

LIAM: Hal spins around, goes up the stairs, leaves. I'm going to make my way up to the roof--

MARISHA: ♪ Making my way ♪

LIAM: -- and look around the neighborhood.

LAURA: ♪ Makin' my way ♪

LIAM: Yes, I've made my way. Do I see anybody that looks like a problem in the vicinity of the building if I walk around the top of the roof?

BRENNAN: Give me a perception check.

LAURA: Guess it wasn't that interesting to him.

MARISHA: How have you been by, the way?

LAURA: Awful.

MARISHA: Yeah, that's fair. You look great.

LIAM: 13.

BRENNAN: 13. You look. Shadows on the city. Downstairs, there's Kattigan Vale, who has an open shiner on his face from a bar fight where two people were murdered. There's Thimble, who is a wanted criminal accomplice who was left for dead in Thjazi's hideout. Teor, whose mentor just headed west this morning and who himself was marked for death by the Halovar family who are here in the city knowing that they did that and then there is Wick, someone that you knew had a reputation for straight-dealing in a family that had a reputation for love of power. Now you're hearing that there's a malevolent magical dimension to the Halovar's previously corrupt noble evil malevolence and you also know that according to Tyranny, it was already bad before he moved against his family and they went and lied or did whatever they did to free Teor in contradiction to the family's wishes. And then there's Murray and Azune, who to everyone else's knowledge have just yelled at a noble and put his subordinate officer in an awkward position vis-a-vis a patrol. So you got two friends downstairs that have day jobs and are okay and everybody else stinks to high heaven.

LIAM: Uh-huh, okay. Shadia is with her friends with the company. Hero is with her mother in the best part of town. I'm going to go to my study and stare at my brother's sword on the desk while they all mull this over.

BRENNAN: You look at that sword. There's a small symbol where the fuller of the blade ends right before the tang enters into the hilt of the sword where it goes from having the indentation and there's a maker's mark there, but you see it looks like a half of a mask but that half, the middle line where the other half is not there is broken by a smirking tongue that comes out of it.

LIAM: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. I'm looking at the deed for the land that my business venture in The Hallowed Round is on and it's everything I've worked at for years and it is not important right now. It just feels like the world is tilting sideways and going down an incline. I haven't held a sword, a real sword with purpose since I was a young man. The only blades I've held in my hand have been stage props for several decades. I pick up the weapon and it is heavier than a stage prop.

BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.

LIAM: And I heft it and hold it in my hand and take a couple of practice swings with it, which I can do believably, I don't know about effectively.

BRENNAN: Yeah.

LIAM: But believably. And I just think of my brother and staring at that face on the sword. What the fuck have you gotten us all into? And I'll just stay there with it and do it.

BRENNAN: You focus on the sword.

LIAM: The sword.

LAURA: He does the sword.

LIAM: Yeah.

MARISHA: (laughs)

BRENNAN: You begin to focus on the sword and as you do--

LIAM: You've never fucked a sword before?

BRENNAN: -- you see from another angle that sinister thing of a half-mask with a tongue coming out the side of the mouth, oh, no, no, no, that's a face in profile and it's someone smiling and sticking their tongue out a little bit playfully. It's not actually that bad when you look at it that way and you begin to look at a sword forged for a long-ago war by the Lloy family.

LAURA: (gasps)

BRENNAN: This is the Liar's Blade. Your brother wielded it well. If you're lucky, maybe you can, too. Downstairs, all of you begin to feel movement in this space. I think Kattigan, you know that this, if it had happened weeks ago, it'd be a foregone conclusion. But it seems like this happened yesterday. If Casimir headed north towards Timmony, that's the direction you've just come from.

ROBBIE: Yeah.

BRENNAN: Those of you gathered here, I think, look in this moment. Azune, I think you also are looking at the events that have been described. You know that word's gotten out from the Crow Keepers. No longer safe in the city. No longer safe in the city. No longer safe in the city and for these two, though you don't know them well, what they're describing, it paints a very clear picture to you.

LUIS: This is a very interesting gathering of people that don't seem to belong here anymore.

TRAVIS: Did you have a lead on where Casimir was heading?

LAURA: Yeah, north.

ROBBIE: Yeah, north.

MARISHA: I've got some contacts still in the thieves' guild.

LAURA: (ironic chuckle)

MARISHA: I know, well you killed some good ones. I'm not going to lie.

LAURA: I didn't do it. I was just going to chop somebody's balls off.

MARISHA: Okay, it doesn't matter. You're implicated in all of this, clearly. So you were there, anyway, but I could still chat around a little bit and see where the money maybe flowed, you know? You've got to follow the money, but honestly, I don't think it really matters at this point. I think you guys know where you've got to go.

TRAVIS: Thimble, where else have we to go?

LAURA: I told Thaz I would make him pay. Let's go make him pay.

MARISHA: Damn, he was another good contact, too. He had the best skulls. (scoff) Assholes.

SAM: I'm starting to think that we might not be able to sleep in the villa tonight. We might have to find a hotel or some sort of suite.

ROBBIE: No, no, fuck that. Kattigan has been-- Above table, this is not a good look. He's on the outskirts of the party wandering around the perimeter of the group meeting just dancing quietly to himself. (giggles) Sort of step-touching around, but watching and what you think you're seeing is a fool and maybe a part of him is. But he's listening to them all and listening to where they have to go and that foolishness starts to fade away and instead of being on the outside of the group, he slowly folds himself back into the circle and at the mention of sleeping in a hotel, he just says: (grumbles) No, no, no. If you're going to go up north, you're going to have to sleep outside.

WHITNEY: Oh!

ROBBIE: Have you ever slept outside before?

SAM: I'm sorry, what's up north?

WHITNEY: Camping.

SAM: Camping. Right.

WHITNEY: Hi, I'm Tyranny.

ROBBIE: I like your name, lovely to meet you.

WHITNEY: Oh, everybody has really big and rough hands except for you. Touch this, they're soft as--

ROBBIE: Let me touch it, just to touch it. Oh my god.

WHITNEY: Soft as a lamb's ear and I would know.

ROBBIE: I feel it, I feel it.

SAM: It's just a little chilly in here is all. Up north, I'm not familiar with that area.

ROBBIE: Well, you're going to fuck off, right?

SAM: I'm sorry?

ROBBIE: You're going to fuck off out of the city?

WHITNEY: Yeah, we're going to fuck off.

ROBBIE: Fuck off with us.

SAM: Oh.

ROBBIE: Are you two new friends or something?

TRAVIS: We are now.

SAM: Oh, really?

TRAVIS: Of course.

WHITNEY: Wick.

SAM: Yes?

WHITNEY: I think now would be a really good time to exhibit one of your teachings, which is humility. I think it would be a really great time to extend a thanks for listening and a plea because now we are in trouble and we are going to have to keep this act up. Maybe we need to find a way to say that we killed this guy. I don't know. People are going to be after us and we need help from friends.

SAM: Right.

WHITNEY: So if you have anything going on in there--

SAM: Right.

WHITNEY: Yeah.

SAM: Yes. Yes. If we need help, there are people in this room who could extend it.

WHITNEY: Yeah, maybe you should ask.

SAM: Yes. Well, in this wonderful house owned by a great man, in the shadow of the death of another man, I humbly ask for protection, shelter, friendship, loyalty, love, and I don't know where to go or what to do. I don't have anyone and I'm very scared and could someone take care of me for a while?

WHITNEY: You're okay, you did great.

TRAVIS: That is a noble list. I can tell you that my life will be in service of yours until my debt is paid.

LIAM: Hal is at the base of the stairs now.

SAM: Whoa, whoa. Really, is that true?

TRAVIS: But the love and the cuddling and all that shit, that's over with.

SAM: No, I don't care about that but that's a huge thing, thank you.

LAURA: That's a huge thing, Teor.

TRAVIS: He saved my life. They were cutting my shadow into pieces.

LAURA: What does that even mean?

TRAVIS: I don't know.

WHITNEY: I'm trying to get your attention. You're flitting around so fast, can I just say something? He's a full idiot, okay?

LAURA: I can tell.

WHITNEY: But he is the only one in his family who has actual ethics. He is the only one who gives a shit and does not want to be manipulating the masses, okay?

LIAM: Thimble.

WHITNEY: You can trust us.

LIAM: Hal's at the bottom of the stairs. There's a sword strapped to his back now, a scimitar. Are we even safe here? Is my family safe here?

LAURA: Nothing I did, everyone in the city knows that Thjazi kept you safe, Hal.

LIAM: What about now?

LAURA: You might make some good use out of that sword.

MARISHA: You can't go, Hal. We've got work to do. We've got to stay here.

LUIS: And here is becoming a lot more dangerous and my young Lord, if you are fleeing because your family now is what is putting you in danger, we must know what that is because the Houses of the Lords, they're taking advantage of Thjazi's death and they're taking action.

MARISHA: And quickly.

SAM: I feel like it might be more than taking advantage, right? My family was directly responsible for this death and possibly responsible for this Casimir person.

MARISHA: Yeah, so you know, it might make me feel better. So if you want to just humor me, maybe humor her, maybe add an apology to that long list of yours that you just rattled off, it might make a lot of us feel better. Because, look, I'm a little new here to all this information dump going on. So I'm not entirely sure why we're protecting this little one. But you know what? Good luck on the road, baby boy.

SAM: Thank you. I believe that there is good and there is evil in this world and if my family has contributed to the darkness--

MARISHA: Take out that "if" right now and then we'll be square.

SAM: My family cast as much shadow as it has light and I must burn it away and rectify it and I will not stop until I do so. I apologize to you for your brother and all of you for the danger you've been placed in and you for, well, I don't know what, but you hate me and that's not good.

MARISHA: Yeah.

SAM: So I'm sorry, but mostly I'm sorry to you, Tyranny.

WHITNEY: To me? Why?

SAM: You've been stuck with me.

WHITNEY: Oh boy.

SAM: This is not your choice and I'm sorry.

WHITNEY: Listen, I hate my family, too, all right? We'll get into it on the road. I think that we, so you guys are aware, we're going to keep this act up. Pious demon, charming leader.

SAM: It's not really an act.

BRENNAN: Give me a history check with advantage.

MARISHA: (giggles)

SAM: History?

BRENNAN: History.

SAM: Not great, eight.

BRENNAN: Eight. Oh, did you do it with advantage?

SAM: Oh, with advantage?

BRENNAN: With advantage.

SAM: Even worse.

BRENNAN: Even worse. Gorgeous. There was something that Thimble said before, some word that she said about a place that just sounded familiar to you. You see place names all the time. Paperwork, the holdings of the Halovar family and there's just something she said that sounded familiar.

LAURA: Oh.

SAM: Was it in the north? What did you say before?

LAURA: Stronghold in Gormalay.

SAM: Gormalay, I think I actually did write that down.

LAURA: (laughs)

SAM: The Halovars have temples all over the place and we ship (sigh) Filament. In our faith, we believe that the universe is a river of light and we are all--

LAURA: I don't care!

SAM: Okay.

MARISHA: (giggles)

SAM: There is a treasured liquid that we ship around.

LIAM: What kind of liquid?

SAM: You might not believe me if I told you, but it's very powerful, magical and some of it has been shipped up there and we may have--

LAURA: So you have a place there? So you have a stronghold in Gormalay?

SAM: I don't know if it's a stronghold, but we do have--

LAURA: Because Casimir had a brand new deed for a stormhold in Gormalay. Did he sell off all of our shit to your family?

SAM: Oh dear. We do buy things a lot and sell things.

MARISHA: Follow the money.

LAURA: How can it be so evil and you have no idea? Insight check, I don't believe him.

BRENNAN: Give me an insight. Hey wait, Laura, give me that with advantage.

LAURA: 17.

BRENNAN: Give me persuasion.

SAM: That's very good, 20.

BRENNAN: I think Thimble, you look and see behind Wick, the person you loved is laid out on a table covered in treasure. Thjazi believed in two things. He believed above all that despite all of the darkness in the world, there was always hope that people might turn and choose a better path, even if it was hard. And he also believed if you had a rich kid in your pocket to help pave the way, that is not a ticket you throw out.

MARISHA: (chuckles)

LAURA: Teor is one of the most honorable people I know and if he says he's got your back, then I do, too.

MARISHA: What about you, big boy? You got my back?

ROBBIE: With that voice?

TRAVIS: Oh jeez.

ROBBIE: I've got your back, your front, your side, your up, your down.

LAURA: Do you want to go take care of business before we head out of town?

ROBBIE: What's that then?

MARISHA: (laughs)

BRENNAN: Azune.

LUIS: Yes?

BRENNAN: If these guys need to get out of town tonight, you know where you can get them horses to get out of here.

LUIS: The question that's running in my mind right now is whether I choose to go with them. I'm watching the three people from the Falconer's Rebellion that I just reunited with and now they're getting out of town and I just started remembering all of this time that we spent together and now they're leaving. And I haven't had much time with you, even though we were in the same city working for the same person, in a way, but I didn't-- But if you need to leave tonight, then I can help.

LAURA: Azune, we're going to make them all pay, yeah?

LUIS: I want to go.

LAURA: You have more pull in this city than any of us combined. Well, except for maybe that shit.

LUIS: Doesn't seem like he has much pull anymore. And as I look over, I see Hal, who I realize maybe a part of me subconsciously in the last 24 hours I've been avoiding and I see you with the scimitar, a visage of a warrior that was never meant to be and I turn back to you, Thimble, and I say: Make them pay for me, too.

LAURA: You need to hunt down everybody in this city that had a hand in it, and you know who they are. Seek them out and take them down.

ROBBIE: Yeah. Yeah, listen to her. That armor looks so big and sturdy, I bet your balls finally dropped, haven't they, boy?

LUIS: I puff up my chest a little bit at that. But I see the glint in your eyes and that smirk on your face, just like I remember when I first met you. Some of you haven't changed at all. I will do what I can here and I will look after the rest of the people here that I care about.

LAURA: For Thjazi.

LUIS: Yeah.

ROBBIE: Kattigan settles in by the fire, knowing we're going and wanting to grab this last little moment of comfort that's so rare in the wild and he lights up a little hand-rolled cigarette and it's probably not anything that should be smoked. So you're going to go up north, yeah? And all the mirth and good humor that's been in him in this evening fades away and he becomes deadly serious. City folk. All your drama, all your interpersonal workings. Have any of you been in the wild, lately? Because let me tell you something. It's not what you think. I just came from Timmony naught but three nights ago and you had better prepare yourselves.

WHITNEY: I am so excited to find out what your deal is, man.

LAURA: (laughs)

WHITNEY: Can I just say really quick, Hal, I don't know if you remember me or not, but I'm such a big fan. You gave me some fruit leather one time when you were helping him with his diction and his public speaking and it was so good. Do you have any more of that, and could you also say, why do people pretend to be other people? It's so crazy to me.

LIAM: To find the truth.

LAURA: Hal, you have some costumes here, right? You have a couple cloaks, at least?

MARISHA: (laughs) Poor Brennan. (laughter)

LIAM: Few blocks away, yeah.

LAURA: We should cover them up. Your robes are pretty noticeable.

SAM: Oh.

BRENNAN: Costume cloaks are easy enough to acquire here in the home of a veteran actor and thespian. Your final moments are shared here in Hal's home. He wears Thjazi's sword on his back. Your final moments with Thjazi, who, if you ever return to Dol-Makjar, will be in his final resting place. Are there any final words shared here before the night welcomes you?

LIAM: As they're about to leave, I catch Thimble by the door and low, with reverberation to his voice, he says: Find him for our brother. And take a Bardic Inspiration with you as you leave.

BRENNAN: I'm going to say with Thjazi's sword on your back at the threshold of your house, the iron nail of the Lloy family overhead. That Bardic Inspiration that you take in that moment will not diminish no matter any amount of time and will increase even if you hold onto it as Hal works for the goals set before him here in this city. You bid farewell.

LIAM: Yeah.

MARISHA: Parting is such sweet sorrow.

ROBBIE: You look warm.

MARISHA: (laughs)

LUIS: I think the silence says more than any words could.

BRENNAN: At the top of the city, bidding farewell to Thjazi, Kattigan, the stables of The Grey Tower stand beside an open balcony high above the waterfall and you look and see a falcon's nest nearby. You draw five horses out here at the Falcon's Rest.

LAURA: I don't need one.

SAM: Is there a carriage of some sort?

LUIS: I'm afraid not.

ROBBIE: You could ride sidesaddle.

SAM: I will, yes.

TRAVIS: (laughs)

LUIS: They don't know what the Falcon's Rest is. I take my Falconers' Rebellion folks and I point out Falcon's Rest.

BRENNAN: This monument to those fallen of Dol-Makjar in the Falconers' Rebellion around the pillars by the balustrade. No names written on where the hands rest. The names here in this monument seem almost hidden under shadow as though in remembering them, Dol-Makjar still had to hide some shame that they did not lend their full support when the falcon's cry rang out across these lands.

LUIS: There's one thing I would like to do. As they start getting ready to leave, I will start to recite the names of those that fought alongside us in the Falconers' Rebellion that did not make it through, and I will keep that going as they ride off.

BRENNAN: Five brought together head north. A brother in danger, a life turned into chaos, and maybe if you're lucky, vengeance. We'll see you five at the Soldiers' table. Farewell.

WHITNEY: (laughs)

BRENNAN: Farewell, and for the rest of you, I'll say farewell as well, though we will be seeing you next week. I need Matt, Alex, and Ashley back here.

WHITNEY: Soldiers. You hear that?

SAM: Yes, I am. (laughter)

BRENNAN: Incredible.

MARISHA: How did that happen?

BRENNAN: Incredible.

SAM: I'm a real boy!

WHITNEY: For real.

SAM: (laughs)

MATT: Got to put your ring somewhere.

LAURA: (giggles) (faintly speaks)

ASHLEY: What if I sat over there?

ALEXANDER: I don't know. It's your decision.

MATT: Where do you want to sit? Yeah, you two probably have a better energy shoulder to shoulder.

ALEXANDER: I get scared if I'm alone.

BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. The Palazzo Davinos. Gorgeous, lit with fairy light, dancing wisps of magic as Julien, Vaelus, Occtis arrive. Vaelus, I believe you were trailing some distance behind with Pincushion in your arms. As you walk through the gardens here at the Palazzo Davinos, you hear the rushing of the river; the Palazzo abuts the River Vroche on the far side. Gardens here are beautiful. Some of these trees aren't from this world. Seeds from far Faerie, Tír Cruthú. Lands beyond grow in this place. Trailing vines. As you arrive, the doors open. Your father, General Raimond. "Julien, well done, my son. I am General Raimond Davinos. You are Occtis Tachonis."

ALEXANDER: Yes, pleasure to meet you.

BRENNAN: "I believe we have some things to discuss."

ALEXANDER: I've been told.

BRENNAN: He enters in. Vaelus, do you approach with him to enter the manor or do you remain in the garden?

ASHLEY: I lean over to Occtis. Would you like me to come with you?

ALEXANDER: I mean, I have no objection, but also we don't know each other, so that's up to you. You can come, if you like.

MATT: With all due respect, Vaelus, it is a bit disquieting to leave you to your own devices on our personal grounds and we are not fully understood of how tethered you might be to this plot either. I would humbly request your presence in this conversation as well.

ASHLEY: Of course.

ALEXANDER: So yeah, come on.

BRENNAN: You enter. Courtiers abound. They're getting ready for a big gala tomorrow night so you see that there's some festivities around. People are decorating garlands of flowers on the gardens. You enter and see the Lady Aranessa Royce, who you saw yesterday at the funeral. She says, "Julien, thank you. Occtis."

ALEXANDER: Good evening.

BRENNAN: "Good evening. Maybe there's a good, quiet place for us to discuss. There's a room higher in the keep, or if you prefer an additional layer of privacy, we have a bedroom that you're welcome to stay in while we're figuring out."

ALEXANDER: Whatever you prefer, I'm here at your disposal.

BRENNAN: "Up to you. There's a drawing room with a fire just up there on the upper balustrade, or if you'd like a place to, if you'd like us to show you to a room because we think it might be good for you to sleep in a place that nobody knows you stay. I understand you're a student of the Penteveral."

ALEXANDER: Yes.

BRENNAN: "You should know that your father visited the Penteveral earlier today."

ALEXANDER: Okay. Well then, I accept your generous hospitality. I will stay here for the time being. What is going on?

BRENNAN: "Well, I believe General Raimond wishes to speak with you, Julien." You see that Aranessa looks and says, "My lady."

ASHLEY: Hello.

BRENNAN: "I'm Lady Aranessa Royce. Welcome to the Palazzo Davinos. This is the house of my vassal, Lord Raimond.

ASHLEY: I'm Vaelus.

BRENNAN: "Vaelus."

ASHLEY: Apologies for how we met earlier.

BRENNAN: "Of course." She looks to you and says, "I'll show you to your chambers and we can discuss."

ALEXANDER: Thank you.

BRENNAN: She begins to walk upstairs with you and says, "How have you found your studies at the Penteveral?"

ALEXANDER: Oh, fine?

BRENNAN: "You're studying-- I know that your family is gifted with sorcerous ability as mine is, but--"

ALEXANDER: Yeah. (snorts) You know, being the eighth kid and all, it didn't quite get to me, you know?

BRENNAN: She looks at Pin in Vaelus' arms and says, "Or it did in its own way."

ALEXANDER: I kind of had to force it. (laughs)

BRENNAN: She smiles and says, "Let's discuss." She walks with you. Raimond looks at you, Julien, and says, "Oh. We have some things to discuss, my son," and they walk up to the side. They get up as they start heading up. Vaelus, I think you, as you're walking up, Aranessa takes Occtis' hand.

ASHLEY: I can stay. I don't need to. I don't need a room.

BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. she smiles and says, "Mm-hmm." And you remain down here in the hall looking at courtiers gathering around. Give me a perception check, if you'd be so kind.

ASHLEY: Ooh. Okay.

BRENNAN: 21. Looking out, this palazzo's beautifully appointed. You see there's a lot of open, bay doors to the gardens. You look out and see servants moving in from kitchens elsewhere. It's just beautiful and very open. Wind moves through the palace. You hear a noise on a 21, distantly. You hear a wolf moving swiftly, somewhere far away. Your ears are powerful and detected it's not even on the ground, but it is approaching distantly. Something wild and magical is moving on the face of the world and you almost hear the call of a nightingale.

ASHLEY: I look around and just anywhere to try to see if I'm actually hearing this or if this is just in my head.

BRENNAN: None of the humans here in this room are reacting or can hear what you can hear, but you hear it coming from the gardens.

ASHLEY: I watch Occtis as he goes up with Lady Aranessa and I will, am I still able to hold onto Pincushion?

ALEXANDER: Yeah.

ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to put Pincushion on my shoulder and I'm going to walk out to the gardens.

BRENNAN: You walk out. You see a distant bridge, a wolf running across a bridge crossing the river. You hear a nightingale song. As you walk through the gardens, you see jasmine growing. (rustles) That wolf needs to get into this garden. The walls of the Palazzo are closed. You need to make sure that that wolf can get in.

ASHLEY: And when I see the wolf, do I sense--

BRENNAN: Aabria, you want to come out?

AABRIA: No.

BRENNAN: No?

ASHLEY: (laughs) (falling noise)

AABRIA: Ow!

BRENNAN: Shit! Shit!

ALEXANDER: It's the wrong wolf.

BRENNAN: It's the wrong wolf!

AABRIA: Wolf down!

ALEXANDER: Wolf down!

ASHLEY: (laughs)

AABRIA: I'm going.

MATT: (chuckles)

AABRIA: Obliterate my knee on the way in. We're doing great!

ASHLEY: All right, so coming over the bridge towards us.

BRENNAN: Yes.

ASHLEY: Okay. So, I am going to--

BRENNAN: Thaisha.

AABRIA: Yeah?

BRENNAN: You hear the song. It's powerful, beautiful, but it's a word of warning. Something magical is happening and you look across the bridge as you are crossing it. You can feel the jasmine heralding your approach. You look across at what can only be described as one dedicated to the memory of a Shaper that took the world of nature for her own and bent it to her will, and you look across, and in this moment, know that doom will befall your world if you cannot find her spirit in your own and she yours.

AABRIA: There is a moment of eye contact and just unbidden, a howl rips from her and it is long and mourning, and then she returns her gaze to you and she is stopped, and gets low. It's something between a pounce, but it's not submission. It is what is about to happen next and she waits and watches you.

ASHLEY: I think hearing that, Vaelus hasn't had this feeling in a long time, almost as if her heart has-- it's beating again for the first time, and hearing that mourning howl, something gets caught in her throat. An emotion, something. I will start briskly walking towards the wolf.

AABRIA: I approach at the same speed.

BRENNAN: The wolf vanishes. You are separated by so much distance, but in this starlight here, it's an unusually clear night for Dol-Makjar. Connecting over this vast distance, the wolf continues into the city and you walk forward seeing multiple small gates in the walls of the Palazzo manned by guards of the Davinos. By whatever measure necessary, you know that a door must be left open for that wolf, as certain as you have ever been about the magic workings of this world.

ASHLEY: I will cast Command.

BRENNAN: You walk up and you see a guard looks over and says, "My lady."

ASHLEY: Open the gate.

AABRIA: Ooh!

BRENNAN: He goes, "Yes." You see that he opens it as the other guard says, "Devin, do you--" And he says, "Yes, my lady." You see is crying without knowing why. Just opens it.

MATT: (laughs)

AABRIA: What's up? (laughter)

BRENNAN: You open the gate and stand in the open doorway.

ASHLEY: I stand in the open doorway and I put a hand out to sniff.

BRENNAN: We move from there. You wait. You can hear the wolf approaching. It will take time for the wolf to go through the city, but this door will be open when that wolf arrives.

ASHLEY: Great.

BRENNAN: We move back into the palazzo. Aranessa arrives up at your room, beautiful little appointed. There's a table in the center of the room. Off to a doorway, there's a little bed chamber. She looks and says, "Occtis, have you done anything that you should not have?"

ALEXANDER: To what are you referring? I'm sure I have--

BRENNAN: Your family believes that you were involved with an attempt to rescue my husband, my late husband.

ALEXANDER: (scoffs) Oh.

BRENNAN: "Why would they believe that?"

ALEXANDER: Can I insight check?

BRENNAN: Yeah.

ALEXANDER: I know she was at the funeral and I know she knows people that I know.

BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.

ALEXANDER: I'm terrible at this. Absolutely not, a two.

BRENNAN: "Our processional caravan behind us was stopped at the eastern edge of the Dvalmar Pass. Do you know why?"

ALEXANDER: Look, I'm just-- I've been out of town for the last six months. I only came back because we heard he was being executed.

BRENNAN: "Occtis, the doors to Faerie closed because the realm of death is so choked with souls that cannot move to an afterlife because we killed the gods, that that energy burst into our world and almost struck the heart of Faerie, killing it forever. Your family and my family each have a castle not in this world, and I don't think many common folk know that."

ALEXANDER: No.

BRENNAN: "My family has a castle in the Golden Orchard halfway between our world and Faerie and it is dying. Your family has a castle in Death."

ALEXANDER: It's doing both, honestly. It's getting more powerful and with every death. I know.

BRENNAN: "Your family's looking for you."

ALEXANDER: Yeah.

BRENNAN: "Thjazi was collecting things towards the end. I believe he was collecting-- He asked Thaisha, and by extension you, to collect something."

ALEXANDER: Yes.

BRENNAN: "What was it?"

ALEXANDER: A box.

BRENNAN: "Did it have any connection to-- I was not able to be granted audience, either by your family or the Halovar. Do you know anything about what his intentions were with the box?"

ALEXANDER: I do not. I only know that we were supposed to bring it back here to him. Obviously, that didn't happen. I believe, to the extent of my knowledge, Thaisha still has the box.

BRENNAN: "Occtis, why is there an elven warrior downstairs?"

ALEXANDER: That is so complicated. I don't know. Apparently your, your late husband stole something from her and she's here to find it. That is the literal reason why she's here, but the reason why she followed me here, I can't say, she's very confusing. But she's here to protect me?

BRENNAN: "What did he steal?"

ALEXANDER: A stone.

BRENNAN: (knocks) "Yes?" She goes and says, "Ah, your bed clothes," and goes to move to the door.

ALEXANDER: Oh.

BRENNAN: We move downstairs. General Raimond is down there. (Raimond) "No word from the carriages at the eastern edge of the pass. The Tachonis are moving. Their forces in the city are maybe triple what we imagined they would be."

MATT: Oh, so this is fairly grave, then. What is going on, Father?

BRENNAN: "I don't know. I don't know why the Lady Aranessa was not met. I don't know. Do you know anything about a, a stone, a missing stone?"

MATT: Julien's head flicks over his left shoulder, almost in the direction of the entryway to the palazzo. Looks at his father. No, I don't.

BRENNAN: "I suppose I owe you some thanks for retrieving Occtis. At least you can follow that direction. Some of your courtiers, your consorts, I believe are waiting upstairs if you wish to help yourself to some of the Cormoray wine."

MATT: He goes to speak up for a second, his body tensing before deflating a bit. Gives his father one more look and leaves the chamber and heads out to where he last saw Vaelus.

BRENNAN: You head out. As you approach, you see Vaelus, or where she must have walked out to the gardens. You see some friends of yours back from the Golden Orchard. Jahar, a broad-shouldered muscular man, goatee, shaven head. Ilondria, who looks as ravishing as ever, her hair tied up in a massive, messy pile with golden chains and small glowing jewels. And Mardonus, whose, his impressive shoulders, bare for all to see, wearing only a vest and breeches with seven-league boots. Look to you and say, you see Jahar goes, "Julien, I can't believe it. You had work today."

MATT: Jahar, it does happen on occasion.

BRENNAN: "We've cracked into some of the finer stuff. Not that Cormoray garbage, but the real Davinos."

MATT: Save some for me, if you don't mind. My work day is not yet complete, believe it or not.

BRENNAN: Ilondria says, "You break my heart."

MATT: Oh, don't let me break it for too long. It won't be the entirety of the evening, my dear, but there are things afoot. If you just give me a bit of patience, please. That's all I ask.

BRENNAN: You see that the three of them say, "Have it your way, Julien." You walk out and see Vaelus out in the garden, standing in the doorway.

ASHLEY: Still standing there and I just am waiting with a hand out.

MATT: Vaelus. What are you doing?

ASHLEY: Waiting.

MATT: For?

ASHLEY: You'll see.

MATT: His bravado crumbles a bit as he gets lost in thought and approaches and steps up beside you, shoulder to shoulder. I don't like the feeling of being overwhelmed, but I feel like the tide is rising and I don't know why or how. I have-- I have a bad feeling about tonight.

ASHLEY: Do you get bad feelings often?

MATT: Yes, but it's usually easy to drink them away. But no, this is, something's happening and I haven't grown up under the, the golden flicker of the house of fae magic to not recognize shifts, these ethereal winds, as omen. You've come here looking for something. This boy is being hunted. My lady is shaken. And from what I can tell a bit in his eyes, I think my father is, too. I don't know why, but a part of me feels like I can trust you.

ASHLEY: Hmm. I believe you can, too. Even though you seem a little bit of an asshole, I feel I can trust you.

MATT: What are you waiting for?

ASHLEY: A wolf.

BRENNAN: Vaelus, you feel your Divine Sense pulsing within you in this moment. As Julien says he has a terrible feeling, you have an ability, based on your connection to something profound and magical, to reach out, a supernatural awareness in this moment, your divine sensibility. You feel it pulsing within your chest as you await the wolf. Give me a perception check.

ASHLEY: Oh, that was almost so good. 14.

BRENNAN: 14. Without, unless you use your Divine Sense from that perception, all you get is there's something deep about Julien's shadow. Something a little bit thicker and more obscure about it. You have the ability to reach out to your Divine Sense if you so wish.

ASHLEY: I would love to.

BRENNAN: Julien-- You reach out. Julien's cursed. As your Divine Sense reaches out, that curse is not the most troubling thing here. This garden beyond Julien is filled with hundreds and hundreds of specters of the restless dead just on the other side of the veil from the living world. Walking out on the steps to the garden, you see General Raimond looks out at you. "Julien. I wanted to say that--" A hand from an invisible figure reaches forward as the invisibility is dropped and a black-clad member of House Tachonis reaches their hand up immaterially through the skin, under his jaw, reaches inside his head, and pulls his skull out of his head, immaterially. Letting go, it becomes corporeal again, and suddenly the upper half of his spinal cord and skull is out in front of the flesh of his head and he dies instantly, collapsing to the ground. Upstairs, with a knock on the door, (knock) stone. Aranessa opens for the servant to bring the bed clothes. The door creaks and suddenly stops creaking as a Silence spell fills the room. You see six black-clad figures wearing Tachonis symbols. As their heads rise, you see the vacancy of six ghouls, full undead, gazing out at you. In the midst you see here, your brother Ethrand casting a Silence spell, holding in his hand a perfectly spherical black stone, wings surrounding it. He looks, speaking in silence. No sound travels, but his lips mouth the words, which is enough for the undead that he commands. "Put him on the table, open him up and we'll put the stone where it belongs."

ASHLEY: Oh!

BRENNAN: And that's all for this episode.

ASHLEY: No! What?

AABRIA: No. Actually, no. Keep going.

ASHLEY: No.

AABRIA: No.

BRENNAN: That's all for this--

AABRIA: Don't turn the camera off.

BRENNAN: That's all for this episode of Critical Role.

ASHLEY: What?!

BRENNAN: We'll see you all next week.

ASHLEY: Wait!

AABRIA: No!

BRENNAN: We'll see you all.

ASHLEY: No, 10 more minutes!

AABRIA: Your dad's head is gone! What?

ASHLEY: Wait, wait, whoa!

BRENNAN: We'll see you all next week for another episode of Critical Role.

ASHLEY: No! No!

AABRIA: Stop! If you don't say it, we have to keep playing.

BRENNAN: I'm sorry for not saying it last week. Huge faux pas on my part. I won't forget this time because Matt's right here. Is it Thursday yet?

MATT: (laughs)

ASHLEY: (groans) No, it's not!

MATT: (laughs)

Cooldown
ALEXANDER: It's actually Tuesday. (laughter)

AABRIA: Wild!

ASHLEY: Whoa! Whoa!

AABRIA: Fuck!

MATT: Well, fuck.

BRENNAN: Well, fuck, man!

ASHLEY: I'm like: Whoa!

AABRIA: I thought he meant that in a metaphysical, a philosophical way.

ASHLEY: I did, too!

AABRIA: But no!

ASHLEY: I was like: Oh, okay. Oh, oh, he's dead.

AABRIA: Shit's bad. Shit's bad immediately. (laughter)

BRENNAN: (wheezes)

AABRIA: Yeah, t-t-tight. T-tight, tight.

BRENNAN: Woo!

ASHLEY: Oh my god!

BRENNAN: I know it's late. I know it's late.

ASHLEY: Oh my god!

BRENNAN: I'm so sorry.

MATT: It's all good.

BRENNAN: We went long.

AABRIA: So good!

BRENNAN: I had to get there.

AABRIA: Oh!

ASHLEY: Oh my god.

AABRIA: (groans)

MARISHA: Why were you so calm about your dad getting decapitated?

AABRIA: Bruh!

BRENNAN: Stunned! Shock! Full shock!

MARISHA: Why didn't you do anything?

MATT: Well, I'm--

MARISHA: You just sat there!

BRENNAN: Yeah.

AABRIA: What are you going to do?

MATT: He was describing it.

BRENNAN: Describing it.

AABRIA: What are you going to do? He took the head!

MATT: And when we come back for the next episode, I can do my immediate reaction. (laughter)

LUIS: We're jumping ahead!

AABRIA: He ungushered the gusher of his father's head. The fuck is he going to do?

MATT: Yeah, no. I very clearly, in my head, knew my reaction, but it wasn't time.

BRENNAN: We cut from that scene.

MATT: Yeah. It wasn't time.

TALIESIN: Cut to the museum. We should order takeout. (laughter)

LUIS: Yeah, we're good.

TALIESIN: Barbecue? Barbecue?

MARISHA: I know!

TALIESIN: Barbecue?

AABRIA: I was having that day until the very end when I was like, oh yeah, we're in the theater.

TALIESIN: (laughs)

WHITNEY: That was very metal, that last--

BRENNAN: Hey, thank you.

AABRIA: Golly!

BRENNAN: You have a bad family. We did a lot with your bad family, but you also have a bad family. (laughter)

AABRIA: I know.

ASHLEY: And you're cursed!

AABRIA: Aw!

MATT: Eh.

TALIESIN: It was hinted at.

ASHLEY: Eh.

AABRIA: It was hinted at.

BRENNAN: I like that we really did a show and tell there. I told you he was cursed and then I had someone pull his dad's skull out of his body and then let it go back to corporeal.

LUIS: Yeah.

MATT: What's interesting, legitimately, that conversation with his dad, he was conflicted about opening to his father about any of the information.

ALEXANDER: Oops!

MATT: Went, more or less, to talk to you, pretty much a complete stranger to get any sort of grounding and then was going to back and talk to his dad.

AABRIA: (gulps)

MATT: It was like--

AABRIA: You can, but in that, "Alas, poor Yorick. I knew him."

MATT: Yeah, that's true.

ALEXANDER: Oh boy.

MATT: Look at me. Look at me.

AABRIA: (laughs) Now it's flopping.

ALEXANDER: Yeah. Wait, just put it back on.

MARISHA: (laughs)

AABRIA: If you do it fast enough, the body doesn't even know.

MATT: I can fix it! I can fix it!

ALEXANDER: I can't even yell.

LIAM: It's fine, it's fine.

AABRIA: Yeah!

ALEXANDER: It's silent in there.

BRENNAN: It's silent in there.

ASHLEY: Oh, that's right.

AABRIA: A little silent but deadly. It's fine.

MARISHA: It's true! No one can hear you yell in Silence spells.

LIAM: Just silent puking.

ALEXANDER: Yeah.

LUIS: (laughs)

AABRIA: There's nothing funnier than you being asked, "Why is she here with you?" It's like, because every woman that meets you is like, "You need a mother."

ASHLEY: Yes.

AABRIA: "You need a mother right now."

TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

AABRIA: I got it. I got it from here. (laughs)

TALIESIN: Speaking of cursed.

TRAVIS: Sam, you do have the most broken character.

MARISHA: Oh my god.

MATT: Yeah, dude.

SAM: It's just a sweet little boy. (laughter)

ASHLEY: Just a sweet little buddy.

MARISHA: That whole beginning scene.

TRAVIS: Yeah.

BRENNAN: Ohh.

MARISHA: Dude, between--

LAURA: Yeah.

AABRIA: It's been a long--

MARISHA: That was today!

LUIS: Yes, exactly.

MARISHA: That was today!

AABRIA: That was today!

BRENNAN: Oh wait, the opening scene, we had the cold open of fucking the Falconer's Rebellion flashback.

ALL: Yeah.

BRENNAN: Where we see Casimir save Thjazi's life.

AABRIA: Oop.

LAURA: What the fuck, Casimir?

BRENNAN: What the fuck, Casimir? What happened, buddy?

AABRIA: What had happened was--

BRENNAN: What happened?

TRAVIS: Don't worry, we'll find him. We'll ask some questions.

MARISHA: I'm still so confused about your deal. Are you actually a little Boy Scout? Are you a little Boy Scout?

TRAVIS: Course.

LIAM: That's Travis.

TRAVIS: You ever not trusted a lion?

TALIESIN: He's grrreat!

AABRIA: That's fair.

LAURA: They're so noble.

TALIESIN: That's a tiger, but still.

ASHLEY: Yeah, they're noble.

MARISHA: Yeah, so noble.

TALIESIN: He's fucked! I don't know.

BRENNAN: Yes, and so this started with, fucking, and the cliffhanger of the last episode which was angel in the basement, and then we had grandma.

LIAM: And went to the tailor.

BRENNAN: Yes. Oh, the tailor!

MATT: Yeah.

LAURA: Oh, the tailor was so great. I loved the tailor.

ALEXANDER: Brennan's describing something and then immediately throwing it out of his brain. (laughter)

TALIESIN: Oh yeah, that shit.

BRENNAN: You got to clear the workbench. You're like--

AABRIA: Yeah.

BRENNAN: All right, these motherfuckers are done for now.

TRAVIS: That was just those twins out front and then the tailor's in the back doing the horrible shit.

BRENNAN: No, no, it was the twins were the tailors.

AABRIA: Yeah.

TRAVIS: Oh, okay.

BRENNAN: And the wigs cover a translucent back of their skull that has an infernal fire in it.

TRAVIS: On fire.

MARISHA: Whoa!

AABRIA: They're so great.

BRENNAN: (laughs) I love the thumbs-up from Robbie. "Hey, man."

TALIESIN: Fuck yeah.

BRENNAN: "Really nasty. Love your work." (laughter)

TALIESIN: Loved every fucking minute of this shit.

WHITNEY: Sam, you're going to make me insane.

ALEXANDER: I'm so--

ASHLEY: Yes.

SAM: I think I'll be okay.

ALEXANDER: Fucking like this right now-- I was like, "Uh, what's happening?" I have no power to fix anything in my life.

BRENNAN: Well, it's also, but it's very it all makes sense because here's the thing.

ALEXANDER: Yeah.

BRENNAN: The ramifications of Casimir's betrayal, the big one obviously is Thjazi's death. But let's be clear, if he betrayed also, people knew there was a plot. And if people knew there was a plot, how many fucking little birds do each of the Sundered Houses have in the city?

ALEXANDER: Yep.

BRENNAN: So all it takes is, it's like, not only is the betrayal bad. The betrayal's also now a security breach and all of a sudden, your family's like, "What do you mean that one we don't care about did something we don't like? Ah."

TALIESIN: Who's the squealer?

LUIS: That's why you're like--

BRENNAN: Yeah.

TALIESIN: Who's the squealer?

ASHLEY: Yeah.

ALEXANDER: Yeah, you make eight so you could lose one and have seven.

AABRIA: Yeah!

TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

AABRIA: You know what they say--

MATT: Play the odds.

AABRIA: -- eighth pancake, trash.

ALEXANDER: Oh man.

MARISHA: No one wants that.

AABRIA: No one wants that one.

MARISHA: Yeah, yeah. It's always the tiny one.

LAURA: That means everybody, though, involved in the plot is in trouble in the city, though. So--

BRENNAN: But also, the thing about that, right, is the--

AABRIA: Story.

BRENNAN: There's an interesting degree of, Murray wasn't in the plot, Bolaire wasn't in the plot, Hal wasn't in the plot. Azune was in the plot, but not necessarily in a way that Casimir needed to know.

ALEXANDER: Yeah.

BRENNAN: In other words, if you think about what Cas needed to know, Cas needed to know that he was getting it to Cyd, right?

ALEXANDER: And Cyd was--

BRENNAN: And that Thimble was the one telling him. I think Thimble, even for having a tight circle, wouldn't have spoiled what Thaisha and Occtis, necessarily, were going to do or what except for the fact that Cyd, if Cyd was the connection to Cas, then if Cyd was the connection to Cas, then Cyd knew that he was going to meet Thaisha and Occtis.

LAURA: Yeah.

BRENNAN: So that's the issue, Azune is pulled out of that from Casimir's perspective.

MATT: It's the only way.

AABRIA: No nobles, no cats.

ALEXANDER: Starting with--

TALIESIN: Salt the earth.

ALEXANDER: -- the five ghouls, please.

ASHLEY: Yes, yes, yeah.

AABRIA: The what?

BRENNAN: The huh?

ROBBIE: Don't worry, we'll all handle this with masterful combat. (laughter)

AABRIA: Oh my god!

TRAVIS: Statistically--

TALIESIN: The wrong date.

TRAVIS: -- the most broken encounter--

LUIS: Yes.

TALIESIN: Tight crew.

LAURA: Your face as you're like, "Oh, I'ma kill them all."

MARISHA: Yeah.

BRENNAN: I'm going to kill them all.

TRAVIS: We're going to have to mic the table.

ALEXANDER: I'm about to have six rouges take sneak attack turns on these--

ASHLEY: No!

LUIS: With their fists.

AABRIA and MATT: With their fists!

LUIS: They weren't even using weapons.

AABRIA: You were just getting sneak slapped. He's like, "I don't know what to do. Just stay down."

BRENNAN: I'm not a monk, but I'm very good at hitting, yeah.

ALEXANDER: Today in Dol-Makjar, three adventurers were kidney punched to death. (laughter)

LIAM: Man, you two gave those tailors the worst blue balls ever.

BRENNAN: (laughs)

LAURA: Oh yes.

AABRIA: Oh god.

WHITNEY: I was so glad that that-- You were not helpful.

ALEXANDER: You were-- (laughter)

SAM: I think I was very helpful!

BRENNAN: Yeah, Tyranny, absolute MVP of that encounter.

AABRIA: When Tyranny's got to drop kayfabe.

TALIESIN: Whitney, welcome to roleplaying with Sam.

WHITNEY: I thought that I was going to be the one, heh heh heh, making his life hard.

TALIESIN: Nope.

WHITNEY: No. (laughter)

WHITNEY: No, no, no, no, no.

AABRIA: Have you met a man?

WHITNEY: I see your game now, and you will be punished. (laughter)

SAM: I don't know what you're talking about. I walked in there, I had a nice conversation, and they gave us our friend.

TALIESIN: And a vest.

AABRIA and MARISHA: And your new vest!

WHITNEY: Yes!

TALIESIN: It's a nice vest.

LIAM: It was like Hannibal Lecter had laid out all, measured all his spices, put them on the table. Okay, let's cut into the meat.

BRENNAN: Yes.

LUIS: Yes.

LIAM: We're not doing it? (laughter)

ASHLEY: Oh?

WHITNEY: I feel so bad that I didn't think in time to be like: And by the way, tell everybody that you did kill him!

BRENNAN: Yes.

WHITNEY: And please.

BRENNAN: No, but it's perfect because now you have to go, right?

WHITNEY, LIAM, and MARISHA: Yeah.

BRENNAN: And we got our first table out the door!

ASHLEY: Yay!

AABRIA: Let's go!

BRENNAN: Thank you, Robbie, that scene was so fucking sick of you being like, "Have you guys been out in the wild?"

LUIS: Yeah.

WHITNEY: Yes!

BRENNAN: I literally was like: Great, and you've done my foreshadowing for that. (laughter)

AABRIA: Robbie saves it up for one line.

BRENNAN: Yeah.

ASHLEY: Yes.

AABRIA: It's like, "Here's Kattigan's one."

MARISHA: Yeah, yeah. (laughs)

AABRIA: It's perfect. Goodbye.

ALEXANDER: I did my one. A bonus to flirt with--

ASHLEY: Yeah, with Murray.

WHITNEY: Wow!

AABRIA: Oh my god. Which was morally correct.

ROBBIE: I know we were racing to the finish, but you'd have given me two more minutes. There was something going on.

AABRIA: Damn! Run it back! (laughter)

AABRIA: Run it back, clip it in!

MARISHA: Look, she'll be here when you get back, sweet boy.

AABRIA: Let's go!

MATT: (laughs)

TALIESIN: Why do I get the sense we're fucked next episode.

AABRIA: Yeah.

TALIESIN: We're really fucked next episode.

BRENNAN: Yes, totally.

MARISHA: I was like: Parting is such sweet sorrow. And you're like, "You look warm." (laughter)

ALEXANDER: That was so funny.

MARISHA: So good. "You're warm."

ROBBIE: You have a full beard, right? Is that correct?

MARISHA: I got a little chinstrap.

AABRIA: Chinstrap.

ROBBIE: Oh, that's so good.

MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

ROBBIE: I was going to take a little hair grease and twist it up a little bit.

MARISHA: Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah.

MATT: (laughs) Oh boy.

MARISHA: It gives a nice little tickle.

ROBBIE: Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

MARISHA: You know?

MATT: No, no. (laughter)

MATT: Yeah. (laughs)

MARISHA: I couldn't help, I kept seeing Kattigan art, and as soon as I saw it I was like: Murray's going to want to climb that like a tree. (laughter)

AABRIA: It is correct to do so.

MARISHA: Thank you, thank you. Yeah.

AABRIA: Thank you, thank you.

TRAVIS: The theater descriptions were so--

AABRIA: Oh my god!

MATT: Yeah.

ASHLEY: Beautiful.

TALIESIN: Can't fucking wait.

AABRIA: Let's go!

BRENNAN: I love that.

AABRIA: Oh!

BRENNAN: We got weird-- I love how many weird things are me and Taliesin speaking in code to each other. You're just like, "Things are bad." And you're like, "Ah, very well. 'Bad' you say." And then-- (laughter)

TALIESIN: I've got everything as--

ASHLEY: "Ah, bad you say?"

TALIESIN: Yeah, I just need to get everybody in a room and then every-- I need to get all the people who can fuck with me out of the city and then I can, everyone in the room who I can kind of trust and we're like, "Okay, here's the awful that's happening right now."

LUIS: Oh.

AABRIA: Wild.

BRENNAN: I guess we're cutting back to Hal's home where actually it's Hal and Murray alone. to Hal's home where actually it's Hal and Murray alone. Which is the time for-- Because you have a letter for Murray that says "Bolaire" on it from Thimble.

TALIESIN: Oh shit, that did happen?

BRENNAN: Yes.

ASHLEY: Oh, that's right!

TALIESIN: Fuck! I thought you had forgotten!

LAURA: I didn't!

TALIESIN: Fuck!

BRENNAN: I did not!

TALIESIN: Goddamn it!

BRENNAN: Absolutely. Oh, I loved that scene at the theater, the scene with Shadia and getting the whole theater.

ASHLEY: Oh my god.

MARISHA: Yeah, that was so good.

BRENNAN: Everyone is doing the coolest shit.

WHITNEY: I was so-- Oh my god, Aabria, you're so fun to watch. I just--

MARISHA: Your momma stuff.

WHITNEY: I just--

AABRIA: Thanks.

BRENNAN: I was talking with Aabria about that specifically about, for reasons that are deeply heartfelt, but also unfair, but you understand them, mom adventurer is-- When mom is like, "I'm going to go save the world." There's something about it that's so heartbreaking where you're like, "Oh--" Even just Shadia being like, "You make joy." You're like, "Making joy is what you and your father do." And your daughter being like, "You make joy for me. You're my mom."

AABRIA: Going to walk into the ocean, become sea foam. (laughter)

TALIESIN: Too real, too real.

AABRIA: It's done. Done.

ALEXANDER: Mom becomes sea foam, that's the wrong person.

TALIESIN: We all done an Ariel.

AABRIA: Yeah. (grunts)

LIAM: Aabria and I put a lot of thought into the kids.

AABRIA: Yeah.

BRENNAN: It's great.

ASHLEY: Oh, I love it.

BRENNAN: Shadia-- I loved.

TALIESIN: They're adorbable.

BRENNAN: I love your theater company, too. We got to see Uli.

AABRIA: They're so sweet.

BRENNAN: It was really crazy because Liam had painted this beautiful picture of this theater company and looking at Uli it's like, "Oh, 85. Fuck!"

AABRIA: Yeah.

BRENNAN: So he saw it. And thank you, Aabria. Everyone is doing the coolest shit. It's very wild for, I don't know, the whole myth of the put-upon DM. Everyone is lobbing up all these awesome opportunities to be like: Do you want to deliver some lore in a way that actually is really filled with emotion of the people involved? Here's lore about the theater and the gods and the orcs and their relationship to the god of war and what that was about. Doing that in a way that is like: Here's what this means, here's how we're dealing with that, here's how we feel about it. Instead of being like, "In the year--" (laughter)

BRENNAN: Does that make sense? It's very, everyone's help-- The degree of people touching the history of this campaign setting in ways that go: Feel something about this, is such a fucking boon. It makes everything easy behind the screen. You guys rule.

ALEXANDER: This was such a good game.

LIAM: Plus, boxed wine was invented in Dol-Makjar.

AABRIA: Boxed wine!

WHITNEY: And boxed sherry, too.

AABRIA: Incredible.

TALIESIN: You fucking hate me.

ALEXANDER: So far, we've invented fantasy Malört.

TALIESIN: You just fucking hate me.

ALEXANDER: We've got cranberry rolls.

BRENNAN: Cranberry rolls, fantasy Malört.

MARISHA: Boxed wine.

WHITNEY: Fruit leather.

ALEXANDER: Fruit leather.

AABRIA: Fruit leather.

TALIESIN: Fucking fruit leather.

AABRIA: And the importance of the height be 5'11".

MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, 5'11".

AABRIA: 5'11".

BRENNAN: I love you said, "Gift shop." That should've been a gift shop." (laughter)

TALIESIN: I have needs and I have demands.

BRENNAN: "I have demands." (laughter)

ALEXANDER: I love, everybody's having a really dramatic time and you're just playing Theater Tycoon. (laughter)

AABRIA: It's so fun because we tried to get it. We're like: What's going on with you? There's no way to know!

TALIESIN: No.

AABRIA: Okay, great.

TALIESIN: We will have that talk very soon.

BRENNAN: I love that we got, Luis, this moment of you being like, "I'm heartbroken to be the one to stay behind." You're watching them leave. (heartfelt groaning)

BRENNAN: You staying by the Falcon's Rest reading the names of the people you lost as your compatriots go because you got put in this position where it's like: Those are my brothers and sister heading off, and I'm going to stay here doing this job that is increasingly surrounded by malevolence and evil.

LUIS: Yeah.

BRENNAN: It just was heartbreaking.

ALEXANDER: Yeah.

LUIS: Well, I mean, it dawned on me midgame. I was like: Oh fuck, I'm not going to play with them for a moment.

LAURA: (sympathetic) Oh!

TALIESIN: Yeah.

LUIS: And then I got sad.

ASHLEY: Oh!

ALEXANDER: (laughs)

TALIESIN: We never even got to meet.

LAURA: I know. I totally thought you were coming.

ROBBIE: Yeah, I did, too.

TRAVIS: "I'm going to stay here," and I was like, oh Jesus, now--

TALIESIN: We never even got to be in a room together.

TRAVIS: Oh fuck, he's not coming.

LAURA: I know! We never even get to talk.

TALIESIN: It breaks my heart.

LUIS: I'm the only one clean from all the crazy shit you did.

ROBBIE: We need you on the wall, man.

LUIS: Yeah. Fuck.

BRENNAN: That thing, too, that scene with you and Murray, as hysterical as your guys' message moment of going back and forth.

ALEXANDER: That was so funny.

BRENNAN: But it is this thing where it's like, "Hey man, my shit's been corrupted!" And you're like, "Well, my shit's been corrupted!" (laughter)

LUIS: Yeah.

BRENNAN: But that moment, getting that incredible moment of Azune looking and being like, "I want to go with my friends," and seeing Hal with Thjazi's sword on his back. Thank you for giving me that opportunity to name the Liar's Blade in that moment. (groaning)

TALIESIN: I lost my shit at that. Oh, love it.

AABRIA: It's such a good-- Oh!

BRENNAN: But seeing, oh, I-- Yeah, he's about to take on-- It really is like taking on a mantle, right? But has to do it in a totally different way because you're a totally different person with a-- Thjazi got to play the hand of, "I'm a shadow. I'm a hero of a lost cause, and I'm dealing from the bottom of the deck." And you're here like, "I'm everybody's friend and I'm clean, and now I have a Liar's Blade on my back."

LIAM: I'm a writer! (laughter)

LUIS: It's been established that you resemble him, right?

LIAM: A little bit, yeah.

LUIS: A little bit. I think it's--

SAM: Does the Liar's Blade have cool tricks? Does it do things?

LIAM: Shit, yeah! (laughter)

BRENNAN: It's sick. It's very cool. I'll let you-- You're welcome to share it in your own time.

LAURA: Dang, I should have made some cool-ass weapons for my character.

ALEXANDER: Yeah, yeah, you--

AABRIA: What are you talking about? That needle you tried to give a vasectomy with was great! (laughter)

WHITNEY: Yeah.

LAURA: I just had slice. I was picturing I was stabbing it in, all right?

ROBBIE: Oh yeah.

MATT: And then slicing around inside.

BRENNAN: That poor dude.

LAURA: Yeah, I was swiveling.

BRENNAN: That poor dude was like, "A fairy went in my pants. I ripped my pants to get the fairy out, and then a fucking legendary temple guardian--" It's such a--

LUIS: Holy shit.

BRENNAN: We know that fantasy worlds have multiple genres in them. That Crow Keeper did not know that. (laughter)

BRENNAN: He was like, "Here's the realm of possibility." He's like, "I know this shady fairy. She's on the down-low doing magic crimes. Oh, this guy's disguise doesn't, whatever. And oh, here's some slinking ranger. He smells like liquor. Oh, a legend from the past!" Blam, dead. (laughter)

BRENNAN: Fucking, I was hit with a weapon. I didn't even know. That looks like a religious artifact, and it is! It's just got knives on it. Blam, dead. (laughter)

ASHLEY: Laura, are you level one?

BRENNAN: Ashley, you kicked so much ass this episode.

ASHLEY: Thanks, man.

LAURA: How dare you? (laugher)

ASHLEY: Oh my god.

WHITNEY: What the fuck?

LAURA: I'm level three!

SAM: Oh, okay. Is everybody level three?

LAURA: I was level one in the flashback.

ROBBIE: She just rolls ones.

WHITNEY: Did you think that you were the only one?

LAURA: Shut up!

SAM: Yes! (laughter)

LAURA: As well as everybody else at this table tonight, thank you very much.

AABRIA: Actually, no. I don't remember it that way.

LAURA: I rolled really well against you. You just used a special-ass feature, okay?

AABRIA: Which was morally correct.

MATT: I'm sorry.

AABRIA: That was so funny.

MATT: I'm sorry I'm an asshole.

LAURA: My wings are sacred, you mother--

BRENNAN: You motherfucker. I know. Laura, I'm going to make a, I'm going to get to work homebrewing a magic item like barbed wing guards. (laughter)

LAURA: Yeah, right?

BRENNAN: Just fucking spikes on my wing.

AABRIA: Make her less snatchable.

ROBBIE: If you want, you can borrow my stick with a rock on it. (laughter)

MATT: That's true.

MARISHA: Also, I do feel like, I mean, we're pre-recording these episodes so I'm very curious at how the audience is handling you smashing a decade of just goodwill and sweet kindness and love and joy of just goodwill and sweet kindness and love and joy that you have been a bastion of for so long.

LAURA: It's fun to be the villain, though.

MARISHA: And now you're bad. You're real bad.

MATT: Look--

BRENNAN: Is Thimble--

MARISHA: You're so bad.

BRENNAN: Oh, Matt. Yes.

MARISHA: Matt is yeah.

BRENNAN: Sorry, yes, Matt. Oh, you nasty man!

AABRIA: The Laerryn in me sees the Julien in you.

LAURA: But it's so cool.

TALIESIN: Burn it to the ground!

BRENNAN: Let's do it. Can we rattle them off? Spitting on corpses.

AABRIA: Yeah.

BRENNAN: We're grabbing fairies by the wings.

LAURA: And--

MATT: To be fair--

LAURA: -- fucking calling me less than.

MATT: To be fair--

LIAM: To be fair!

MATT: -- you started it.

LUIS: (laughs)

LAURA: Listen--

BRENNAN: Hey.

MATT: I full on was going to keep it civil.

LAURA: I could smell your spit on Thjazi when I landed on him, okay?

ROBBIE: Ooh!

BRENNAN: Everyone point to the person you think I was closest to killing this episode.

ROBBIE: Mm.

LUIS: Closest to killing?

LAURA: Closest to killing this episode?

LUIS: I mean, yeah.

ROBBIE: Oh, yeah.

WHITNEY: Yeah.

BRENNAN: Now I'm going to point and I want this to be a way that we all learn about each other heading into this big campaign together. Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing! Right here!

AABRIA: No!

MARISHA: Oh, that's right.

BRENNAN: Primus Tachonis.

MARISHA: That's fair.

AABRIA: No, he liked it.

BRENNAN: I was like, "Straight up, draw a different dwarf because this one's--" (laughter)

ALEXANDER: Yeah, that was, I forgot--

MARISHA: Well, you started to be like, "I'm going to kill her."

BRENNAN: I'm Murray's twin sister Shmurray because I'll tell you this right now, it-- (laughter)

ALEXANDER: Yeah, I was standing back there like: My dad's going to kill Marisha.

MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, you did. You said that. You were like, "You're"--

LIAM: You were sassing him--

AABRIA: I was right outside.

LIAM: -- really bad, man.

AABRIA: You could fuck him, keep going.

MARISHA: I know.

AABRIA: He likes it.

MARISHA: Legit, it took everything in my power to not be like: You want to go right-- To not just throw fists. I was like: I can't do that. I can't do that."

SAM: You'll die.

MARISHA: That's bad. I will die.

ALEXANDER: Incorporeal reach into your face and just take your whole beard off.

ASHLEY: Yes. Just take the skull and spine out.

LIAM: Not level three, that guy.

MARISHA: No, no.

AABRIA: Just take the beard off you face!

TALIESIN: He'd Mortal Kombat you pretty hard.

ROBBIE: You boiled down to a head-to-head roll where if you'd have lost, you had to do a wisdom save before every action, wasn't that one?

AABRIA: Yeah, so funny.

TALIESIN: That looks like an empty Capri-Sun, man.

BRENNAN: So it's an upcast Bestow Curse.

ALEXANDER: It's a very good spell.

BRENNAN: It would have been 24 hours with a wisdom save every turn or lose your action.

MARISHA: Jeez Louise.

LUIS: Oh, and you're exhausted.

AABRIA: It's only every six seconds for a whole day. Like, whatever. It's fine.

MARISHA: Yeah, it's not so bad.

ALEXANDER: Yeah, Bestow Curse rocks.

LUIS: Don't sleep tonight.

ALEXANDER: I love that spell.

AABRIA: I was in the back cheering for him to kill you guys during the fight.

BRENNAN: I know we're bopping around timing-wise. I just wanted to say, this scene, the bathtub scene with Tyranny and Wick was so great.

ASHLEY: Oh!

AABRIA: Yes!

MARISHA: So good, dude.

BRENNAN: I just loved Tyranny's whole-- I mean, it broke my fucking heart when you kept being like, "I can't be saved." Because it's this perspective where it's like, but you are different from the other demons!

WHITNEY: Lost cause, baby!

BRENNAN: Lost cause.

WHITNEY: I just want to say--

TALIESIN: Speaking of sea foam.

WHITNEY: I told you this before Marisha, but Marisha was beginning, top of the show, she's like, "Everybody, keep it tight. Everybody, move with intention and don't do too much exposition." And I was like: Cool, I have so much lore of Sam's. (laughter)

BRENNAN: Well, it was a great one-two punch because the grandma scene was so fucked up and it was very much--

ASHLEY: Oh my god.

WHITNEY: Yeah.

BRENNAN: Crafting--

ALEXANDER: I love her.

ASHLEY: Me too.

AABRIA: I want Yanessa and Julien to kiss and make the nastiest--

SAM: What?

ASHLEY: Yes.

BRENNAN: It's great because I told Sam, I made the Yanessa to honor what I love about Sam as a performer. Everyone here, I have things that I'm trying to honor in all your performances.

SAM: Is that a compliment?

AABRIA: No.

BRENNAN: But the thing was, I was like, I want someone who is true, that you're like, "Oh, she's funny." And then you're like, "Wait, there's a deep malevolent pathos." You know what I mean? You're like, she's a little bit like, "Innit? Ah-ha, I'm a little-- We have to tell lies--" (laughter)

BRENNAN: You have that thing where you're like, "Hi, you're cute. Are you fucked up? You're fucked up, right?"

WHITNEY: She's so scary!

BRENNAN: And it felt, so to have that scene and then to have the follow up of it be that deep connection.

ALEXANDER: It's very sweet.

SAM: You're so good, Whitney.

WHITNEY: No. (laughs)

SAM: I was trying not to make your life a living hell.

WHITNEY: Yeah, it's my turn next.

BRENNAN: Wait, I'm counting on you to not keep that promise. (laughter)

MARISHA: Bro.

ROBBIE: So we rode off into the sunset. Does this mean the Soldiers have an episode off?

BRENNAN: The soldiers have an episode off because we are going to move to our other two tables next week.

AABRIA: I didn't get to say bye to Tyranny.

BRENNAN: When we come back, it will be a long term-- It will be an adventure with Thimble, Teor, Kattigan, Wick, It will be an adventure with Thimble, Teor, Kattigan, Wick, and Tyranny heading north to Timmony to find Casimir and maybe if you're lucky find Cyd, find Teor's brother, you know? I loved that, the bond of debt of you being like, "You fucking save my life," and he did. He fucking saved your life.

TRAVIS: Yep. That's it. Then Thimble, too, having this moment of like, "Why am I going to trust this fucking asshole whose family--" And the idea of being like, Thjazi believed in the good of people. Also, if you're heading somewhere where this guy can grease a palm or pave the way, it's not a bad thing. His family knows he fucked up, but there's Halovar servants all over the world who aren't going to be CCed on a fucking half a million person memo.

MARISHA: Yeah.

BRENNAN: You know what I mean?

LUIS: Oh god.

ALEXANDER: Yeah.

BRENNAN: Right?

LUIS: Yeah.

ALEXANDER: I also really like that I said, I'll see you later, because I thought I was going to meet up with you in an hour.

LAURA: Yeah.

ALEXANDER: And now you're gone, and I'm dead. (laughs)

LAURA: No!

BRENNAN: You might make it. Who knows? You're with Aranessa--

ALEXANDER: With five ghouls and my brother?

BRENNAN: You're with Aranessa. She's got moves.

ALEXANDER: Oh yeah, she can kick some--

AABRIA: Does she?

LAURA: Aranessa's badass. Aranessa's badass.

AABRIA: She didn't have moves to keep her husband.

BRENNAN: Let's find out. (shouting)

MARISHA: Well, on that note! (laughter)

TRAVIS: Good job, Brennan Lee Mulligan!

BRENNAN: Hey, love you guys.

AABRIA: Yeah!
